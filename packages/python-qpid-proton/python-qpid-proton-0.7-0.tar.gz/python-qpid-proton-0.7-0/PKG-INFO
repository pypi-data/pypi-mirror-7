Description: This package contains the Python bindings for the Apache
        QPID Proton library.  In order to use these bindings, you must first install
        the Proton library (libqpid-proton) and C header files on your system in order
        to build the binding's C-based extension.  These development files may be
        provided by your system's distribution (for example, the qpid-proton-c-devel
        RPM is available for Centos via EPEL, or libqpid-proton2-dev for Ubuntu via the
        Apache Qpid PPA (ppa:qpid/proton).  If your distribution does not make these
        packages available, you can download the Proton sources directly from the
        Apache Qpid project: http://qpid.apache.org
        
        This release is compatible with the 0.7 release of the Proton
        development libraries.
