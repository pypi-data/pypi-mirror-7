Welcome to the KAT Communication Protocol's documentation!
==========================================================

KATCP is a simple ASCII communication protocol layered on
top of TCP/IP.

It is developed as a part of the `Karoo Array Telescope <http://ska.ac.za/>`_
(KAT) project and used at KAT for the monitoring and control of hardware
devices.

The protocol specification :download:`NRF-KAT7-6.0-IFCE-002-Rev5.pdf`
is maintained as an internal memo. The latest version is `Rev5`.
