Installing the Python Katcp Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install the latest version of the KATCP library by running :command:`pip
install katcp` if pip is installed. Alternatively, :command:`easy_install
katcp`; requires the setuptools Python package to be installed.

Using the Blocking Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The blocking client is the most straight-forward way of
querying a KATCP device. It is used as follows::

    from katcp import BlockingClient, Message

    device_host = "www.example.com"
    device_port = 5000

    client = BlockingClient(device_host, device_port)
    client.start()
    client.wait_protocol() # Optional

    reply, informs = client.blocking_request(
        Message.request("help"))

    print reply
    for msg in informs:
        print msg

    client.stop()
    client.join()

After creating the :class:`BlockingClient <katcp.BlockingClient>` instance, the
:meth:`start` method is called to launch the client thread.  The
:meth:`wait_protocol` method waits until katcp version information has been
received from the server, allowing the KATCP version spoken by the server to be
known; server protocol iformation is stores in client.protocol_flags. Once you
have finished with the client, :meth:`stop` can be called to request that the
thread shutdown. Finally, :meth:`join` is used to wait for the client thread to
finish.

While the client is active the :meth:`blocking_request
<katcp.BlockingClient.blocking_request>` method can be used to send messages to
the KATCP server and wait for replies. If a reply is not received within the
allowed time, a :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.

If a reply is received :meth:`blocking_request
<katcp.BlockingClient.blocking_request>` returns two values. The first is the
:class:`Message <katcp.Message>` containing the reply. The second is a list of
messages containing any KATCP informs associated with the reply.


Using the Callback Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For situations where one wants to communicate with a server
but doesn't want to wait for a reply, the
:class:`CallbackClient <katcp.CallbackClient>` is provided::


    from katcp import CallbackClient, Message

    device_host = "www.example.com"
    device_port = 5000

    def reply_cb(msg):
        print "Reply:", msg

    def inform_cb(msg):
        print "Inform:", msg

    client = CallbackClient(device_host, device_port)
    client.start()

    reply, informs = client.callback_request(
        Message.request("help"),
        reply_cb=reply_cb,
        inform_cb=inform_cb,
    )

    client.stop()
    client.join()

Note that the :func:`reply_cb` and :func:`inform_cb` callback functions are both
called inside the client's event-loop thread so should not perform any
operations that block. If needed, pass the data out to from the callback
function to another thread using a :class:`Queue <Queue.Queue>` or similar
structure.


Writing your own Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If neither the :class:`BlockingClient <katcp.BlockingClient>` nor
the :class:`CallbackClient <katcp.CallbackClient>` provide the
functionality you need then you can sub-class
:class:`DeviceClient <katcp.DeviceClient>` which is the base class
from which both are derived.

:class:`DeviceClient` has two methods for sending messages:

    * :meth:`request <katcp.DeviceClient.request>` for sending request
      :class:`Messages <katcp.Message>`
    * :meth:`send_message <katcp.DeviceClient.send_message>` for sending
      arbitrary :class:`Messages <katcp.Message>`

Internally :meth:`request <katcp.DeviceClient.request>` calls
:meth:`send_message <katcp.DeviceClient.send_message>` to pass messages to the
server.

.. note::

    The :meth:`send_message <katcp.DeviceClient.send_message>` method does not
    return an error code or raise an exception if sending the message
    fails. Since the underlying protocol is entirely asynchronous, the only
    means to check that a request was successful is receive a reply message. One
    can check that the client is connected before sending a message using
    :meth:`is_connected`.

When the :class:`DeviceClient` thread receives a completed message
:meth:`handle_message` is called.  The default :meth:`handle_message`
implementation calls one of :meth:`handle_reply`, :meth:`handle_inform`
or :meth:`handle_request` depending on the type of message received.

.. note::

    Sending requests to clients is discouraged. The :meth:`handle_request`
    is provided mostly for completeness and to deal with unforseen
    circumstances.

Each of :meth:`handle_reply`, :meth:`handle_inform` and :meth:`handle_request`
dispatches messages to methods based on the message name. For example,
a reply message named :samp:`foo` will be dispatched to :meth:`reply_foo`.
Similarly an inform message named :samp:`bar` will be dispatched to
:meth:`inform_bar`.  If no corresponding method is found then one of
:meth:`unhandled_reply`, :meth:`unhandled_inform` or :meth:`unhandled_request`
is called.

Your own client may hook into this dispath tree at any point by implementing
or overriding the appropriate methods.

An example of a simple client that only handles replies to :samp:`help`
messages is presented below::

    from katcp import DeviceClient, Message
    import time

    device_host = "www.example.com"
    device_port = 5000

    class MyClient(DeviceClient):

        def reply_help(self, msg):
            """Print out help replies."""
            print msg.name, msg.arguments

        def inform_help(self, msg):
            """Print out help inform messages."""
            meth, desc = msg.arguments[:2]
            print "---------", meth, "---------"
            print
            print desc
            print "----------------------------"

        def unhandled_reply(self, msg):
            """Print out unhandled replies."""
            print "Unhandled reply", msg.name

        def unhandled_inform(self, msg):
            "Print out unhandled informs."""
            print "Unhandled inform", msg.name


    client = MyClient(device_host, device_port)
    client.start()

    client.request(Message.request("help"))
    client.request(Message.request("watchdog"))

    time.sleep(0.5)

    client.stop()
    client.join()


Client handler functions can use the :func:`unpack_message
<katcp.kattypes.unpack_message>` decorator from `kattypes` module to unpack
messages into function arguments in the same way the :func:`request
<katcp.kattypes.request>` decorator is used in the server example below, except
that the `req` parameter is omitted.

Writing your own Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating a server requires sub-classing :class:`DeviceServer <katcp.DeviceServer>`.
This class already provides all the requests and inform messages required by the
KATCP protocol.  However, its implementations require a little assistance from the
sub-class in order to function.

A very simple server example looks like::

  from katcp import DeviceServer, Sensor, ProtocolFlags, AsyncReply
  from katcp.kattypes import (Str, Float, Timestamp, Discrete,
                              request, return_reply)

  import threading
  import time
  import random

  server_host = ""
  server_port = 5000

  class MyServer(DeviceServer):

      VERSION_INFO = ("example-api", 1, 0)
      BUILD_INFO = ("example-implementation", 0, 1, "")

      # Optionally set the KATCP protocol version and features. Defaults to
      # the latest implemented version of KATCP, with all supported optional
      # features
      PROTOCOL_INFO = ProtocolFlags(5, 0, set([
          ProtocolFlags.MULTI_CLIENT,
          ProtocolFlags.MESSAGE_IDS,
      ]))

      FRUIT = [
          "apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi",
      ]

      def setup_sensors(self):
          """Setup some server sensors."""
          self._add_result = Sensor.float("add.result",
              "Last ?add result.", "", [-10000, 10000])

          self._time_result = Sensor.timestamp("time.result",
              "Last ?time result.", "")

          self._eval_result = Sensor.string("eval.result",
              "Last ?eval result.", "")

          self._fruit_result = Sensor.discrete("fruit.result",
              "Last ?pick-fruit result.", "", self.FRUIT)

          self.add_sensor(self._add_result)
          self.add_sensor(self._time_result)
          self.add_sensor(self._eval_result)
          self.add_sensor(self._fruit_result)

      @request(Float(), Float())
      @return_reply(Float())
      def request_add(self, req, x, y):
          """Add two numbers"""
          r = x + y
          self._add_result.set_value(r)
          return ("ok", r)

      @request()
      @return_reply(Timestamp())
      def request_time(self, req):
          """Return the current time in ms since the Unix Epoch."""
          r = time.time()
          self._time_result.set_value(r)
          return ("ok", r)

      @request(Str())
      @return_reply(Str())
      def request_eval(self, req, expression):
          """Evaluate a Python expression."""
          r = str(eval(expression))
          self._eval_result.set_value(r)
          return ("ok", r)

      @request()
      @return_reply(Discrete(FRUIT))
      def request_pick_fruit(self, req):
          """Pick a random fruit."""
          r = random.choice(self.FRUIT + [None])
          if r is None:
              return ("fail", "No fruit.")
          delay = random.randrange(1,5)
          req.inform("Picking will take %d seconds" % delay)

          def pick_handler():
              self._fruit_result.set_value(r)
              req.reply("ok", r)

          handle_timer = threading.Timer(delay, pick_handler)
          handle_timer.start()

          raise AsyncReply

      def request_raw_reverse(self, req, msg):
          """
          A raw request handler to demonstrate the calling convention if
          @request decoraters are not used. Reverses the message arguments.
          """
          # msg is a katcp.Message.request object
          reversed_args = msg.arguments[::-1]
          # req.make_reply() makes a katcp.Message.reply using the correct request
          # name and message ID
          return req.make_reply(*reversed_args)


  if __name__ == "__main__":

      server = MyServer(server_host, server_port)
      server.start()
      server.join()


Notice that :class:`MyServer` has three special class attributes
:const:`VERSION_INFO`, :const:`BUILD_INFO` and
:const:`PROTOCOL_INFO`. :const:`VERSION_INFO` gives the version of the server
API. Many implementations might use the same
:const:`VERSION_INFO`. :const:`BUILD_INFO` gives the version of the software
that provides the device. Each device implementation should have a unique
:const:`BUILD_INFO`. :const:`PROTOCOL_INFO` is an instance of
:class:`ProtocolFlags` that describes the KATCP dialect spoken by the server. If
not specified, it defaults to the latest implemented version of KATCP, with all
supported optional features. Using a version different from the default may
change server behaviour; furthermore version info may need to be passed to the
:func:`@request` and :func:`@return_reply` decorators.

The :meth:`setup_sensors` method registers :class:`Sensor <katcp.Sensor>` objects with
the device server. The base class uses this information to implement the :samp:`?sensor-list`,
:samp:`?sensor-value` and :samp:`?sensor-sampling` requests.  :meth:`add_sensor` should be
called once for each sensor the device should contain. You may create the sensor objects
inside :meth:`setup_sensors` (as done in the example) or elsewhere if you wish.

Request handlers are added to the server by creating methods whose names start
with "request\_".  These methods take two arguments -- the client socket that
the request came from and the request message.  Notice that the message argument
is missing from the methods in the example. This is a result of the
:meth:`request <katcp.kattypes.request>` decorator that has been applied to the
methods.

The :meth:`request <katcp.kattypes.request>` decorator takes a list of
:class:`kattype <katcp.kattypes.KatcpType>` objects describing the request
arguments. Once the arguments have been checked they are passed in to the
underlying request method as additional parameters instead of the request
message.

The :meth:`return_reply <katcp.kattypes.return_reply>` decorator performs a
similar operation for replies. Once the request method returns a tuple (or list)
of reply arguments, the decorator checks the values of the arguments and
constructs a suitable reply message.

Use of the :meth:`request <katcp.kattypes.request>` and :meth:`return_reply`
decorators is encouraged but entirely optional.

Message dispatch is handled in much the same way as described in the client
example, with the exception that there are not :meth:`unhandled_request`,
:meth:`unhandled_reply` or :meth:`unhandled_request` methods. Instead, the
server will log an exception.

Event Loops and Thread Safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each client and each server starts a network event-loop in a new thread,
although this design may change in the future. In the case of a purely
network-event driven server or client, all user code would execute in the thread
context of the server or client event loop. Therefore all handler functions must
be non-blocking to prevent unresponsiveness. Unhandled exceptions raised by
handlers running in the network event-thread are caught and logged; in the case
of servers, an error reply including the traceback is sent over the network
interface. Slow operations (such as picking fruit) may be delegated to another
thread as shown in the `request_pick_fruit` handler in the server example.

If a device is linked to processing that occurs independently of network events,
one approach would be a model thread running in the background. The KATCP
handler code would then defer requests to the model. The model must provide a
thread-safe interface to the KATCP code.

All the public methods provided by this katcp library for sending `!replies` or
`#informs` are thread safe. Furthermore, updates to :class:`Sensor` objects
using the public setter methods are also thread-safe, provided that the same is
true for all the observers attached to the sensor.

In addition to the network event-loop, subclasses of :class:`DeviceServer
<katcp.DeviceServer>` also start a sampling reactor thread. This is used to send
sensor updates to clients on the basis of the requested sampling
strategies. This means that subclasses of :class:`DeviceServer
<katcp.DeviceServer>` automatically support all the sampling strategies
specified by the KATCP spec.

Backwards Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Server Backwards Compatibility
------------------------------

A minor modification of the first several lines of the example in
`Writing your own Server`_ suffices to create a KATCP v4 server::

  from katcp import DeviceServer, Sensor, ProtocolFlags, AsyncReply
  from katcp.kattypes import (Str, Float, Timestamp, Discrete,
                              request, return_reply)

  from functools import partial
  import threading
  import time
  import random

  server_host = ""
  server_port = 5000

  # Bind the KATCP major version of the request and return_reply decorators
  # to version 4
  request = partial(request, major=4)
  return_reply = partial(return_reply, major=4)

  class MyServer(DeviceServer):

      VERSION_INFO = ("example-api", 1, 0)
      BUILD_INFO = ("example-implementation", 0, 1, "")

      # Optionally set the KATCP protocol version as 4.
      PROTOCOL_INFO = ProtocolFlags(4, 0, set([
          ProtocolFlags.MULTI_CLIENT,
      ]))

The rest of the example follows as before.

Client Backwards Compatibility
------------------------------

The :meth:`DeviceClient <katcp.DeviceClient>` client automatically detects the
version of the server if it can, see
:ref:`release_notes_0_5_0a0_server_version_auto_detection`. For a simple client
this means that no changes are required to support different KATCP
versions. However, the semantics of the messages might be different for
different protocl versions. Using the :func:`unpack_message
<katcp.kattypes.unpack_message>` decorator with `major=4` for reply or inform
handlers might help here, although it could use some `improvement
<https://github.com/ska-sa/katcp-python/issues/1>`_.

In the case of version auto-dection failing for a given server, 
:meth:`preset_protocol_flags <katcp.DeviceClient.preset_protocol_flags>` can be
used to set the KATCP version before calling the client's :meth:`start` method.
