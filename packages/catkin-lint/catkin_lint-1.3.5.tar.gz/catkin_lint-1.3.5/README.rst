catkin_lint
############

Overview
========

**catkin_lint** checks package configurations for the
`catkin <https://github.com/ros/catkin>`_ build system of `ROS <http://www.ros.org>`_. 
It is part of an ongoing effort to aid developers with their ROS packaging
(see also: `issue #153 <https://github.com/ros/catkin/issues/153>`_).

Installation
============

**catkin_lint** is available as `PyPI package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/catkin_lint>`_
and `Ubuntu PPA package <https://launchpad.net/~roehling/+archive/latest>`_.
It can also be downloaded from `GitHub <https://github.com/fkie/catkin_lint>`_
and installed manually with ``python setup.py install``.

Build status of latest version:

Running
=======

**catkin_lint** runs a static analysis of the ``package.xml`` and
``CMakeLists.txt`` files. It can detect and report a number of common
problems.

If **catkin_lint** is invoked with one or more paths as parameters, it
searches for packages recursively and checks all of them. Alternatively, the
``--pkg`` option can be used to add the path of a particular ROS package.

If neither paths nor packages are specified, **catkin_lint** looks for a
package in the current working directory.

A more detailed list of command line options can be obtained by running
``catkin_lint --help``.

Limitations
===========

**catkin_lint** emulates a limited subset of CMake. It does not
evaluate boolean expressions in ``if()`` clauses, emulates ``find_package()``
calls with mock values, and ignores ``function()`` definitions.

Catkin Build Integration
========================

It is recommended to run **catkin_lint** at workspace configuration time.
The simplest way is to symlink ``/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake``
to your ``$WSDIR/src`` folder manually (do not use ``catkin_init_workspace``).
Then add the following ``CMakeLists.txt``::

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
    execute_process(COMMAND catkin_lint "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}" RESULT_VARIABLE lint_result)
    if(NOT ${lint_result} EQUAL 0)
        message(FATAL_ERROR "catkin_lint failed")
    endif()
    include(toplevel.cmake)

Diagnostic Levels
=================

**catkin_lint** has messages in three different categories:
errors, warnings, and notices. The ``-W`` option controls which problems
are reported to the user:

- ``-W0``: only errors are reported (this is the default)
- ``-W1``: errors and warnings are reported
- ``-W2``: errors, warnings, and notices are reported

Normally, **catkin_lint** returns a non-zero exit code if and only
if errors occurred. The ``--strict`` option causes **catkin_lint** to
treat any reported problem as error.

Errors
------

Errors are severe enough to break the build and/or produce unintended
side effects. Usually, they violate the rules outlined in the
`catkin manual <http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/>`_

Warnings
--------

Potential errors which may indicate a bug in your package but may be
justified for reasons **catkin_lint** cannot discern. Constructs which
trigger a warning can usually be modified in a way that is functionally
equivalent but more robust.

Notices
-------

Issues which are not objectionable from a technical view point but
should  be addressed to improve the quality of the package. Many notices
highlight violations of the recommendations and best practises from the
catkin manual.

Contribution
============

**catkin_lint** is still under active development and lacks a number
of features:

* Support for upcoming package.xml format 2
* Unit tests with full coverage
* Check proper usage of external libraries (e.g. Qt)
* Support for CMake functions

If you would like to contribute, you are very welcome to do so.
