Description: Eve-docs
        ========
        
        A blueprint that generates documentation for
        `Eve <https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve>`__ APIs in HTML and JSON
        formats. Eve-docs creates the documentation from your existing Eve
        configuration file, with no additional configuration required.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Clone this repo into your Eve application and modify your launch script
        to activate the blueprints:
        
        ::
        
            from flask.ext.bootstrap import Bootstrap
            from eve_docs import eve_docs
            ...
            Bootstrap(app)
            app.register_blueprint(eve_docs, url_prefix='/docs')
        
        After restarting, documentation is availabile at the ``url_prefix``
        defined in your launch script. ``example.py`` shows how to do this using
        the launch script from Nicola Iarocci's
        `eve-demo <https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve-demo>`__ repo.
        
        HTML output
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The HTML documentation is produced using the
        `Flask-Bootstrap <https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap>`__ blueprint.
        Expand each domain to show available endpoint methods, and further
        expand each method to show parameter details. A screenshot with one
        method expanded follows, and you can also view a `fully expanded
        example <http://charonex.com/img/evedocs-example2.png>`__. |Sample
        output|
        
        JSON output
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Documentation is also exposed as JSON at ``url_prefix/spec.json`` for
        programmatic consumption. Example output:
        
        ::
        
            {
              "base": "http://localhost:5000",
              "domains": {
                "people": {
                  "/people/{_id}": {
                    "GET": {
                      "label": "Retrieve a person",
                      "params": [
                        {
                          "name": "_id",
                          "type": "string",
                          "required": true
                        }
                      ]
                      ...
