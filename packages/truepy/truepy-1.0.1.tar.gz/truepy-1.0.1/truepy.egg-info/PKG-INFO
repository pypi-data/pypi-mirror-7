Description: TrueLicense compatible license manager for Python
        =================================================
        
        This package supports managing licenses one the format used by the Java package
        `TrueLicense <https://truelicense.java.net/>`_. Only the version 1 format is
        supported.
        
        Please see the *TrueLicense* home page for an exhaustive reference of the
        license format, or `Quick license format description`_ below.
        
        
        Quick license format description
        --------------------------------
        
        A license has a validity window in time, an issuer, a holder and various meta
        data.
        
        It is signed by the holder, and the signature can be verified using the issuer
        certificate.
        
        The license file is also encrypted with a key derived from a password.
        
        
        Quick library reference
        -----------------------
        
        The main class exported by *truepy* is ``truepy.License``.
        
        - To generate a new license, use the class method ``truepy.License.issue``.
        - To load a license from a file or stream, use the class method
          ``truepy.License.load``.
        - To save a license to a file or stream, use the method
          ``truepy.License.store``.
        - To verify the siganture of a license, use the method
          ``truepy.License.verify``.
        - To read license information, use the ``truepy.License.license_data``
          attribute; this is of the type ``truepy.LicenseData``.
        
        Loading and storing licenses requires only the license password; these
        operations do not perform signing and signature verification.
        
        Issuing a new license requires the private key of the issuer certificate.
        
        Verifying a license signature requires the issuer certificate.
        
        
        Quick application reference
        ---------------------------
        
        Please run the application with ``python -m truepy -h`` for more information.
