# Configurations

scheduler.combined = bool
  => whether or not all scheduling work should be
     done locally or assume that a separate pscheduler
     process is working somewhere else... add WARNING
     to the documentation that you MUST NOT operate
     with multiple processes if this is set to 'true'
     (the default)

scheduler.housekeeping = interval, eg. 24h
  => this would schedule an interval job via APS
  => default: 24h
  => housekeeping means cleaning up the job status table
     it MUST be non-None (otherwise APS exits)

scheduler.queues = (none) | list-of-valid-queues
  => cause an error if request for non-existing queue
     none => only 'default' queue is allowed
     list => set of allowed queues
