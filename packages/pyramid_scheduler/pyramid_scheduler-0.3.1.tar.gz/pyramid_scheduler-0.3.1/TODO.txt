* generate API documentation with sphinx
* if pyramid_exclog is installed, make use of it
* make the sqlalchemy kombu driver clean up old messages
* make kombu sqlalchemy backend use a provided session and not auto-commit
* make kombu sqlalchemy backend, if psycopg2 engine, use LISTEN/NOTIFY
* submit a patch to APS that allows them to use non-naive datetime objects
* review all of the "limitations", and either fix them, or detect and raise:
  * do a round-trip test of the callback handler to ensure that it is loadable
  * do not silently drop jobs...
  * check that all datetime objects are 'naive'... can they be auto-corrected?...
