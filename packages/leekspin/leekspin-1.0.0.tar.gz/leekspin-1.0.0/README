 Leekspin: An Onion Router descriptor generator
================================================

Leekspin (á la `the original internet masterpiece <http://leekspin.com/>`_) is
a small library for generating mocked Onion Router (OR) descriptors, such as
`those used by relays and bridges
<https://metrics.torproject.org/formats.html#descriptortypes>`_ within `Tor
<https://www.torproject.org>`_ in order to convey information about said
relay/bridge to directory authorities (DirAuths), the bridge authority
(BridgeAuth), clients connecting to the network (a.k.a. Onion Proxies (OP)),
etc.

This library is meant to be used to generate mock descriptors for testing
other Tor libraries and programs, such as `Stem
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/stem.git>`_ and `BridgeDB
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git>`_.

Installing
==========

The very simplest way, if you use `pip
<http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_, would be to do::

    $ pip install leekspin

Otherwise, the standard setuptools commands work just fine::

    $ git clone https://github.com/isislovecruft/leekspin.git
    $ cd leekspin
    $ python setup.py install --record installed-files.txt

Running
=======

Leekspin will install a script named… ``leekspin``. To use it to generate 20
descriptors, do::

    $ leekspin -n 20

TODO
====

Currently, Leekspin only creates `bridge descriptors such as these
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/DESCRIPTORS.md>`_
. Much of Leekspin should be refactored, with new classes created based on
those used in Stem to create pretty data structures for each type of
descriptor. After that, Leekspin's functionality should be extended to also be
capable of creating relay descriptors.
