A high level pipeline pattern implemented in Python with ZeroMQ.

Pipeline is a data and task distribution pattern for distributed
and parallel computing. This implementation abstracts away many details of ZeroMQ
while keeping all the performance advantages the framework offers.

This library focuses more on task distribution than data distribution, since
distributing data creates a memory bottleneck and tends not to scale well.

Client workers are responsible for both retrieval and processing of data
in this implementation.
