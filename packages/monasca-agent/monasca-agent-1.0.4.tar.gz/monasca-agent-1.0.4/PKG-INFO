Description: #monasca-agent
        
        The Monasca Monitoring Agent is a system for gathering metrics and sending them to
        the Monitoring API.  In its basic configuration, the Agent collects metrics
        on various aspects of the host system, but may be extended with Python-based
        plugins or statsd-compatible clients.  Many plugins are included, and some of
        these may be used to gather metrics against remote systems and services as well.
