    """
    File monitor action which always raises an exception.

    This is meant to be a simple way to test the error handling of a file
    monitor.  For example, whether or not file processing continues for
    subsequent files after the first error is encountered.  If logging
    configuration dictates that an email should be sent, it will of course test
    that as well.
