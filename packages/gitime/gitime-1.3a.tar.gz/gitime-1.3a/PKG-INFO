        ======
        
        Keep track of your billable hours along with your commits. Gitime lets you build an invoice with your tasks and hours worked from your commit messages.
        
        `Read the docs <https://github.com/jongoodnow/gitime/tree/master/docs>`_ for more details
        
        Simple Usage
        ------------
        
        Set your hourly rate::
        
            $ gitime set -r 50
        
        Start a new invoice::
        
            $ gitime invoice -n "Awesome Secret Project"
        
        Time how long you've been working::
        
            $ gitime timer start
        
        Make a commit as you would normally, but on the commit step, use `gitime` instead of `git`::
        
            $ git add feature.c
            $ gitime commit -m "Added a really cool thing"
            $ git push
        
        Or, if you don't like timers, record the time yourself with the `--hours` flag::
        
            $ gitime commit -m "Proved Riemann Hypothesis" --hours 2
        
        Look at your invoice::
        
            $ gitime status
            On invoice Awesome Secret Project
            Total time worked: 3 hours
            Total charges:     $150.00
            Charges:
            07-21-2014         1 hour          Added a really cool thing
            07-22-2014         2 hours         Proved Riemann Hypothesis
        
        When it's time to bill, export your invoice to a spreadsheet. Currently, the only format available is csv. More formats are coming soon::
        
            $ gitime export
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You'll need two things installed to use gitime:
        
        - `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, and an executable called `git` on your path
        - `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
        
        Install the latest release with::
        
            $ pip install gitime --pre
        
        Or install the development version with::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/jongoodnow/gitime.git
            $ cd gitime
            $ python setup.py install
