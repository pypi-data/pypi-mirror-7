Description: ===========
        Quick start
        ===========
        For a proper installation of *Kiwi*, follow the instructions in the Documentation.
        
        For a quick flavor of *Kiwi*, you can download the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI), open the command-prompt, navigate to the folder where the package was downloaded, and run:
        
        	> tar -xvf KiwiDist-put.version.number.tar.gz
        	> cd  KiwiDist-put.version.number
        	> python -c "import kiwi; kiwi.plot(gsn="kiwi/demo/GSN.txt", gss="kiwi/demo/GSS_LUAD.txt", gls="kiwi/demo/GLS_LUAD.txt", gsc="kiwi/demo/GSC_LUAD.txt")"
        
        This command fails if the dependencies (chiefly numpy, matplotlib, networkx) are not properly installed for the Python interpreter called by the command prompt.
