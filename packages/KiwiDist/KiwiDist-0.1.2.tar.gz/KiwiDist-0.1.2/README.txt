Quick start
===========
Kiwi is a pure Python module, thus it can be run from source. A quick and simple way to try 
it out is to download the package from Python Package Index (PyPI), extract it, 
navigate to the module directory (/kiwi) and run it from that working directory.

A demo can be run by issuing the following command from the command-prompt:

> python kiwi.py -gsn demo/GSN.txt -gss demo/GSS_LUAD.txt -gls demo/GLS_LUAD.txt -gsc demo/GSC_LUAD.txt

Make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed for the Python interpreter called by the command prompt.
