Description: ==========
        Groundwork
        ==========
        
        Groundwork is a small set of a template tags and filters that simplifies
        working with Zurb Foundation. Many common django components like paginators,
        messages, and forms can be used natively with this package. These components
        get wrapped in nice pretty Foundation goodness.
        
        Naming Note
        -----------
        This package was called Groundwork instead of Foundation to avoid collision
        with other packages of that name (or similar). It also symbolizes the simplicity
        of the tools this package provides. Like Foundation itself, this package just
        provides you with the groundwork needed to make sexy web apps. It is not
        intended to be an entire framework or provide programmtic equivalences to all
        the foundation components.
        
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        1. Install Groundwork using pip::
        
            pip install django-groundwork
        
        2. Add "groundwork" to your INSTALLED_APPS like so::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'groundwork',
            )
        
        3. Include the groundwork URLConf in your project urls.py like so::
        
            url(r'^goundwork/', include('groundwork.url')),
        
        4. Start your development server and navigate to localhost:8000/groundwork to 
           see an example foundation page.
        
        5. You can remove the URLConf from step 2 when you want, it is not needed to
           use this package, it just provides a new example.
