Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a simple smartcard applet that sits in the system tray and shows
        whether a smartcard has been plugged in or not.
        Right click on the icon reveals the list of smart card readers attached to
        the machine and you can optionally have your screen locked when you remove
        the smart card.
        Main purpose of the applet is to simplify smartcard application debugging 
        under Ubuntu, Debian and other Linux distributions.
