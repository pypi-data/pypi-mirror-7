Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a simple smartcard applet that sits in the system tray and shows
        whether a smartcard has been plugged in or not.
        Right click on the icon reveals the list of smart card readers attached to
        the machine and you can optionally have your screen locked when you remove
        the smart card.
        Main purpose of the applet is to simplify smartcard application debugging 
        under Ubuntu, Debian and other Linux distributions.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Event driven architecture, no naive polling
        * Card reader add and remove
        * Smartcard insertion, removing and hot reset
        * Lock screen via DBus
        * The applet is automatically launched via /etc/xdg/autostart
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Simply issue following:
        
        .. code::
        
            sudo pip install esteidtray
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * Ubuntu hides tray icons, some sort of new API has to be used there
        * Unlock screen, possibly not required because of already existing PAM modules
        * Better debuggin capabilities, eg. is pcscd running?
        * Use pykcs11 to read certificate and warn user if the certificate is about to expire
        * Debianize the package and set it as dependency for estonianidcard at http://packages.koodur.com
