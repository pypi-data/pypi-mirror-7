        Keyword Extractor
        =================
        
        Keyword Extractor provides convenient auto-extraction of document key words
        based on term-frequency/inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF), word
        positioning, and other related features. 
        
        Extractor handles all of the pre-processing details, and produces final
        statistic reports in JSON format.
        
        See the guide in docs for usage.
