Description: Python XTEA
        
            This is an XTEA-Cipher implementation in Python 3 (eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm).
        
            XTEA is a very fast and small blockcipher with 8 bytes blocksize and 16 bytes Keysize (128-Bit).
            The algorithm is secure at 2014 with the recommend 64 rounds (32 cycles). The minimum for rounds is  38 (19 cycles).
            This implementation supports following modes of operation:
            ECB, OFB
            More modes will be added.
        
        
        Example:
        
            >>> from xtea3 import *
            >>> key = b" "*16  # Never use this key in practise
            >>> text = b"This is a text. "*8
            >>> x = new(key, mode=MODE_OFB, IV=b"12345678")  # Never reuse the IV!
            >>> c = x.encrypt(text)
            >>> text == x.decrypt(c)
            True
            
        Note
           
            I does NOT guarantee that this implementation is secure. If there are bugs, tell me them. The old version for Python 2 will be still updated.
