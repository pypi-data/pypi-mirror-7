        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Moment.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Moment.js`: http://momentjs.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.momentjs``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``moment`` from ``js.momentjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.momentjs import moment
          >>> moment.need()
