How to use?
===========


You can import ``moment`` from ``js.momentjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment
  >>> moment.need()

The timezone plugin is available as well:

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment_timezone
  >>> moment_timezone.need()

By default no timezone information is included. However you can choose
to include all the timezone data:

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment_timezone_with_data
  >>> moment_timezone_with_data.need()
