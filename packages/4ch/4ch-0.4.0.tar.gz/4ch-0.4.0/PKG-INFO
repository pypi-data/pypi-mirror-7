        fourch (stylized as 4ch) is a wrapper to the 4chan JSON API, provided by moot. It allows you to interact with 4chan (in a READONLY way) easily through your scripts.
        
        Originally <strike>stolen</strike> forked from `e000/py-4chan <https://github.com/e000/py-4chan>`_, but then I moved repos and renamed stuff since I'm pretty bad about that.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 2.7 (what I test with, 2.x might work)
        - requests
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        - This isn't guaranteed to work all the time; after all, the API may change, and 4ch will have to be updated accordingly.
        - If a feature is missing, open an issue on the `repo`_, and it may well be implemented.
        
        Running / Usage
        ---------------
        
        - Install & import: ``$ pip install 4ch``, ``import fourch``
        - See the `docs`_
