Description: Change default Plone behavior in **locking documents** management: add a new (specific) permission
        instead of relying onto the modify permission.
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Plone has a native locking protection given bt the `plone.locking`__ module but, as said in the
        documentation, users able to modify a document can always steal the lock.
        
        __ https://github.com/plone/plone.locking
        
        How this works
        ==============
        
        This add-on adds a new different permission for locking: ``collective.filteredlocking: Can unlock objects``.
        
        Users without this permission will be not able to unlock the document until it's released by the owner or
        lock expires.
