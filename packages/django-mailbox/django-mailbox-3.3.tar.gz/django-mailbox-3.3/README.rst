How many times have you had to consume some sort of POP3, IMAP, or local mailbox for incoming content, 
or had to otherwise construct an application driven by e-mail?
One too many times, I'm sure.

This small Django application will allow you to specify mailboxes that you would like consumed for incoming content; 
the e-mail will be stored, and you can process it at will (or, if you're in a hurry, by subscribing to a signal).

- Documentation for django-mailbox is available on
