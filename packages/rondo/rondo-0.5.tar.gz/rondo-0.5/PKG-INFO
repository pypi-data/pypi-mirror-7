        Record and replay mouse and keyboard actions in Oracle VirtualBox sessions.
        
        Rondo records actual execution behavior, not video, essentially enabling VirtualBox users to create OS-wide macros.
        
        VMware has offered a similar feature called [Enhanced Execution Record / Replay](http://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2008/04/enhanced-execut.html) since 2008, but Rondo brings that functionality to Oracle VirtualBox.
        
        Install with:
        
            pip install rondo
        
        Run with:
        
            rondo [--r record_log_file] [--p replay_log_file] virtual_machine_name
        
        Tips
        ---
        It helps to start the mouse at the same location between record and replay sessions because Rondo stores relative mouse movements. Pay close attention to the guest OS's state to avoid misplaced mouse/keyboard executions.
