# Distributions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forcedotcom/distributions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forcedotcom/distributions) [![Latest Version](https://pypip.in/version/distributions/badge.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distributions)

Distributions provides low-level primitives for Bayesian MCMC
inference in Python and C++ including:

* special numerical functions,
* samplers and density functions from a variety of distributions,
* conjugate component models (e.g., gamma-Poisson, normal-inverse-chi-squared),
* clustering models (e.g., CRP, Pitman-Yor), and
* efficient wrappers for mixture models.

Distributions powered a machine-learning-as-a-service for Prior Knowledge Inc.,
and now powers machine learning infrastructure at Salesforce.com.
