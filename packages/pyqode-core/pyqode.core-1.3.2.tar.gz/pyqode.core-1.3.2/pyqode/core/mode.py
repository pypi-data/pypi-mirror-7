    Base class for editor extensions. An extension is a "thing" that can be
    installed on the QCodeEdit to add new behaviours or to modify the
    appearance.

    An extension is added to a QCodeEdit by using the
    :meth:`pyqode.core.QCodeEdit.installMode` or
    :meth:`pyqode.core.QCodeEdit.installPanel` methods.

    Subclasses must/should override the following methods:
        - :meth:`pyqode.core.Mode._onStateChanged`
        - :meth:`pyqode.core.Mode._onStyleChanged`
        - :meth:`pyqode.core.Mode._onSettingsChanged`

    :attr:`pyqode.core.Mode.DESCRIPTION` to setup the mode name and
    description:
