This example show how to save and load a PropertyRegistry (style or settings).

We will use two QCodeEdit. For the first, we will change change some style
properties to create a simple dark style that we will save to a file.

We will then load this file to setup the style of the second editor instance.

(The file is saved to user home directory and deleted when the application
terminate.
