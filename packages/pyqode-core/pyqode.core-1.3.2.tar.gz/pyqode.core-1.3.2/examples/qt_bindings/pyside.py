This example show the various way to force using the PySide bindings instead
of PyQt4 which is the default.

When using PySide the easiest way is just to import any PySide module/package
before pyqode
"""
import os
import sys
# first import something from PySide
from PySide.QtGui import QApplication
# then import any pyqode package
import pyqode.core


def main():
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    editor = pyqode.core.QGenericCodeEdit()
    editor.show()
    # show the api pyqode is currently using
    editor.setPlainText("pyQode using %s" % os.environ["QT_API"])
    app.exec_()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
