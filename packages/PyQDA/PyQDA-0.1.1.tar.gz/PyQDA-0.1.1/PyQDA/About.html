<H1 CLASS="western">About PyQDA</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Version:</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">PyQDA 0.1.1 November 2013</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Depends on Python 2.7 and PyQt4</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Tested on: Ubuntu 13.10</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For Pdf importing, pyPdf needs to be
installed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For network graph plots python-igraph
needs to be installed.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Problems</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I did have some problems with unicode
conversions, so the plainer the text the better. I have not tried to
use PyQDA with other language/character sets. I have also not tested
the software on othe operating systems. It has been tested on Ubuntu.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is an option in the RQDA database
for image coding but this has not been implemented yet.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">History</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I used RQDA for qualitative analysis of
survey responses. I really appreciate the work of Ronggui Huang and
Zhang Gehao for developing RQDA. See
http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">RQDA worked well for my purposes.
However, during an Ubuntu upgrade the software stopped working. It
relied on igraphfix which was not installed in the upgrade (the fix
was to install igraphfix: sudo apt-get build-dep igraph).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I thought, well this was a good
opportunity to use and develop my Python and PyQT programming skills.
So I decided to write this Python software to utilise the Sqlite RQDA
database.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I hope PyQDA is useful to others and
can complement the RQDA project.</P>
