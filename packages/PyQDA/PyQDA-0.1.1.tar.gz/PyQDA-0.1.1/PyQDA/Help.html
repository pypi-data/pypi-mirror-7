<H1 CLASS="western">Overview</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The various functions of the software
are described here. To follow the process of using these functions
using a working example there are four additional files: <I>ID1.docx,
ID2.odt, transcript.txt</I> and <I>attributes.csv</I>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Text files can be imported from plain
text, <I>docx</I> and <I>odt</I> format. Text files can be entered
manually through PyQDA.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">PyQDA has not been tested on operating
systems other than Ubuntu and non-English character sets have not
been tested.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Text can be coded and codes can be
ordered into categories. Annotations can be added to the text. Code
reports can be generated including SQL queries. Reports can be
exported as plain text or html files. Codes and categories can be
renamed, merged and deleted. Memos can be assigned to the entire
project, codes, files, cases and attributes.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Project menu</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Create new project</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Create a new project under the
'Project' menu - lets call it test. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Again, under the 'Project' menu click
on 'Project memo'. This is a memo about your project. Type &quot;A
test QDA project&quot; and click the OK button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Under the 'Project' menu is a
'Settings' option. Settings allows you to change the coder name and
the coder table. There are two coder tables which are used to compare
one coder with another coder to be able to determine the reliability
of the coding scheme. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Open project</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Use this option to select and open a
project. Opening a project automatically closes any previously opened
project.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Close project</H2>
<P>Use this option to close a currently open project.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Project memo</H2>
<P>General notes about the current project can be entered and viewed
here.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Settings</H2>
<P>The coder name can be entered here. There are two coding tables
for coder 1 and coder 2. The coder 2 setting should be used once an
initial coding of the text is completed and a second coder is
employed to code the text and provide a measure of agreement with the
initial coding.</P>
<P>Font and font size are  not currently implemented.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Files and cases menu</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Manage files</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Add some written material. In the menu
bar select <I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Manage files</SPAN></I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
and a file management dialog is presented. </SPAN></SPAN>Import the
documents <I>transcript.txt, ID1.docx, ID2,odt.</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is a transcript of a discussion
between three students names ID1, ID2 and ID3. The ID1 and ID2 files
contain the written thoughts of two students. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><A NAME="__DdeLink__274_1279364544"></A>
While in the Manage files dialog, create a new file ID3 in the <I>Manage
files</I> dialog. Enter the following text into this file: &quot;I
really like the history course, but I am struggling with the
assignments. I am not a good writer as English is not my first
language.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You will see a memo column. Click the
memo square next to <I>transcript.txt</I> to open a memo. Type the
following text into the memo: &quot;transcript from a discussion at a
recent tutorial&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You will notice the memo square now
says <I>Yes</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> indicating a memo
exists</SPAN>. To delete any memo, open the memo, delete all text
from it and click the OK button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">File names can be changed by
double-clicking on the file name.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">PDF files can be imported. I am using
the PyPdf module for this. This does not provide any formatting or
spacing so you have been warned.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Manage cases</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Open the <I>Manage cases</I> dialog.
Add the three students here by adding three cases. Call each student:
ID1, ID2 and ID3. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Cases are useful for assigning
attributes such as age and sex. You can add a memo to each case and
rename a case by double-clicking on a case name. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm">Now lets add each student's file to
each student. Click on a case, say ID1, then click the <I>Add file to
case</I> button. Select the <I>ID1.docx</I> file. Add the other files
to the other cases. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Click the <I>Open file</I> button and
open the <I>ID1.docx</I> file. The file text is loaded into the right
pane. Click on case ID1 in the case table. Now you can see all the
text of this file has been assigned to ID1 as it has underlined in
red. Notice that the other cases do not have this effect on this
file, but they do if you open the other student files. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now open the <I>transcript.txt</I>
file. you can assign text manually by selecting a case then selecting
text in the file and clicking the <I>Mark file text</I> button.
However, you can also assign text by selecting a case then clicking
the <I>Auto assign file text</I> button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Notice the transcript begins with a
student id inside []. Try automatically assigning text to ID1 by
selecting case ID1 then clicking the <I>Auto assign file text</I>
button. You will be asked which file or files to assign the case to.
Select <I>transcript.txt</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> from
the list</SPAN>. Next you need to enter the start and end marks. The
start mark will be '[id1]' and the end mark will be '['. Now select
case ID1 and you will see all the text from the start mark to just
before the end mark is assigned to case ID1. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mark the other cases as well. With ID2
you will get a warning that one end mark was not found. This can be
fixed manually by selecting ID2 then selected the missed text and
clicking the <I>Mark file text</I> button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you make any mistakes with any
cases, select the case then click on the underlined text and click
the <I>Unmark file text</I> button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The <I>View case</I> button shows all
the text in all the files that is associated with the selected case.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">File categories 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Select <I>File categories</I> from the
menu. We have two types of files, a transcript and student thoughts.
Create two categories for these file types: transcript, students. Now
select the <I>transcript.txt</I> file and select the Transcript
category. Click the <I>Link</I> button to link the file with the
category. You can check that this file is linked to the Transcript
category by clicking the <I>View</I> square to see those files linked
to this category. Now link the student ID files to the Student
category. You can highlight all three files by clicking with the
mouse and holding down the 'ctrl' button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you make a mistake you can unlink by
selecting the File category and the file you wish to unlink. You can
only unlink when the category View is selected. Finally, you can
merge File categories together, but you be warned might need to save
a copy or your .rqda file first as there is no undo for this
operation. You can also delete file categories, again there is no
undo option. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Manage Journals 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Select <I>Manage journals</I>. You can
create journals to write down your thoughts and ideas when
investigating the text and developing themes. 
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Attributes</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Attributes are variables associated
with files or cases. They can be useful to add context to the text
analysis.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Manage Attributes</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Open the <I>Manage Attributes</I>
dialog. Add an EducationLevel attribute for the students, ensure this
is of type character. Attributes can be character, numeric (or
non-assigned if created in RQDA). Once you have created an
EducationLevel attribute, you can give it a memo describing the
attribute.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Double-click
on an attribute name to change the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">attribute
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">name. Files can also be
assigned attributes if needed. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The
Cases and Files columns show whether attributes are associated with
cases, files or both.</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><I>A</I><I>ssign</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
</SPAN><I>Attributes</I></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">You can enter
attribute values for each case or file by clicking on table cells and
entering values. If non-numeric values are entered into a numeric
field the field reverts to the original value.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Import Attributes</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Importing Attributes from a CSV file.
The first row must contain the attribute headings and the very first
heading must be either <I>file</I> or <I>case</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
so that file or case entries are correctly matched. Note that this is
case sensitive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Open the
</SPAN><I>attributes.csv</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> file to
see how it is laid out. Import the attributes from this file through
the </SPAN><I>Import Attributes</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
dialog. Once the attributes have been imported, open the </SPAN><I>Assign
Attributes</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> dialog to see the
imported information.</SPAN></P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Coding menu</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Codes</H2>
<P>This is the central dialog for assigning codes to text. Once text
segments are coded, hovering the mouse over the coding shows the code
name as a tooltip. Clicking on the coded segment also shows the code
name.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">View File</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To begin coding you need to view some
text. Select a file to view from the list presented in this dialog.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Add</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Add codes using this dialog. Memos can
be added and are used for the basis of a codebook. Codes can also be
assigned a colour. If no colour has been selected the text is marked
with a gray colour.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Delete</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A code can be deleted by selecting the
code then pressing the <I>Delete</I> button. You will be asked to
confirm the deletion.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Annotate</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Add an annotation (like a memo) to a
point in the text. You will see a text character will become <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>bold</B></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
to mark the position of the annotation</SPAN></SPAN>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Auto Code</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Select a code then click the <I>Auto
Code</I> button. Enter the text you want to autocode. The next dialog
asks for one or more files to autocode. All matching text will be
assigned the selected code.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Mark</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Highlight some text and select a code,
then click the <I>Mark</I> button to assign the code to the text.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Unmark</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To remove a code from text, click on
the coded text then press the <I>Unmark</I> button.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Categories</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Codes can be collated into categories.
Add a category using the <I>Add</I> button. Delete a category by
highlighting then clicking <I>Delete</I>. Rename a category by
double-clicking the category name. To assign codes to a category,
highlight the codes with mouse, you can use the 'ctrl' or 'shift'
buttons to select multiple codes, highlight a category and then click
<I>Link</I>. To unlink,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Click the <I>View linked</I> square to
see the codes assigned to each category. You will see the <I>Link</I>
button will become inactive and the <I>Unlink</I> button will become
active. To unlink codes from the category, select any codes and click
<I>Unlink</I>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Selected codes can be merged by
clicking the <I>Merge Codes</I> button. The dialog will ask you to
select the code you would like to keep. A similar function  for
categories is available using the <I>Merge Categories</I> button. A
word of warning, there is no undo function, it would be best to save
a copy of the <I>rqda</I> file first.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Categories and linked codes can be
visualised using the drop-down list. Most of the options in the list
show graphs (or maps) of connections between selected categories and
codes. Categories are always shown in uppercase. The various options
position the codes and categories in different ways. The last item in
the selection list produces a table of codes linked to each selected
category. The codes are ordered from the most frequent to the least
frequent for each category.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Codebook</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A codebook is a list of your codes.
Each code memo should detail the reasons behind assigning each code
to the text. The codebook can be exported to a text file.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Reports</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Coding reports</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This report gives a list of coded text.
One or more codes need to be selected and one or both of <I>coder 1</I>
and <I>coder 2</I> need to be selected. The <I>Search</I> button will
present the results.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If a category is selected all codes in
that category are also selected. Multiple categories can be selected
using the mouse and the 'ctrl' button. Codes and categories can be
sorted to help find the codes of interest.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Codings can be narrowed down by using
the <I>Search Text</I>  function or the <I>File selection</I> button.
Only codings within the selected files will be presented, or if this
function was not used all files are used. If text is entered into the
<I>Search text</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> field</SPAN>,
only codings which contain the matching text will be presented.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Codings can also be narrowed down to
case selections using the <I>Case selection</I> button. Note that
when case selections are used, file selections are ignored. Also when
file selections are used, case selections are ignored. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Reports can be exported to text or html
files.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">SQL statements</H2>
<P>This dialog contains three panes. The top pane is where SQL
statements are entered and the bottom pane contains the results of
queries.  The left pane contains tables and field names.
Double-clicking on a field name adds it to the SQL statement. Results
can be exported to a text file.  If you are not familiar with SQL
take care as you will be able to update and delete the data as well
as select data.</P>
