Description: PyMVPA is a Python module intended to ease pattern classification analyses of large datasets. It provides high-level abstraction of typical processing steps and a number of implementations of some popular algorithms. While it is not limited to neuroimaging data it is eminently suited for such datasets.
        PyMVPA is truly free software (in every respect) and additionally requires nothing but free-software to run.
