The purpose of dot2tex is to give graphs generated by Graphviz_ a more LaTeX
friendly look and feel. This is accomplished by converting xdot output from
Graphviz_ to a series of PSTricks_ or `PGF/TikZ`_ commands. This approach allows:

    * Typesetting labels with LaTeX, allowing mathematical notation
    * Using native PSTricks and PGF/TikZ commands for drawing arrows
    * Using backend specific styles to customize the output
