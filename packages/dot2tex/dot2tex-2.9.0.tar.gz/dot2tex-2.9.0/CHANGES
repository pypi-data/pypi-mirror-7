dot2tex change log
==================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each dot2tex release.

2.9.0
-----

Released 2014-05-16.

- Added support for preprocessing head and tail label (pgf and tikz).
- Graphviz arrow styles are now mapped to corresponding PGF/TikZ arrows.
- Project is now hosted on GitHub.
- Numbers are now outputted as floats. Some versions of Graphviz uses scientific notation
  for small numbers. TeX does not handle that well [issue #11].
- Added support for more Graphviz node shapes when using the tikz output format:
  square, diamond, trapezium and star.
- Fixed compatibility issue with Pyparsing 2.0.1.
- Fixed a bug in preprocessing triggered by using the ``--styleonly`` option
  with the tikz output format.
- The number of sides in the hexagon tikz shape is now correct. Thanks to Jean Pichon for
  reporting this.
- Added support for the point shape when using the TikZ output format.
- Node labels are no longer shown when the node shape is point and the output
  format is TikZ.
- Fixed issue 14. Parsing of dimension data from the TeX-log is now
  more robust and the ``--autosize`` option should now work in Cygwin.
- Added the ``--progoptions`` option for passing options to the graph layout program.
- Documentation is now built using Sphinx
- Cleaned up internal error handling.
- When dot2tex fails to parse a graph, dot2tex will now raise an exception
  and quit. In previous versions dot2tex attempted to run the graph through
  Graphviz first.
- Log handlers are no longer configured when using dot2tex as a library.
- Fixed [issue 20]. ``format=positions`` no longer fails if node coordinates
  are floats. Thanks to Nicolas Thiery for reporting this bug.
- Fixed several bugs in the parsing of ID numerals. The bug caused labels
  like ``label="1.2.3.4"`` to be interpreted as ``label=1.2`` [issue 17].
  Thanks to Vsevolod for reporting this.
- ``stdout`` is now properly restored after parsing dot data. Thanks to Nicolas Thiery
  for the patch.
- Parentheses, ``()``,  in tikz node names are now replaced with ``{}``. Parentheses are not valid
  characters in node names. Tanks DamienJadeDuff for reporting this.

2.8.7
-----

Released 2009-10-05.

- Edges with no edge points are now properly handled.
- Added the ``positions`` output format that returns a dictionary with node
  names as keys and (x, y) tuples as values. Works only when called as a module.
  Feature suggested by Nicolas Thiery.
- Fixed handling of ``stderr`` when creating xdot data. Thanks to Nicolas Thiery
  for reporting this bug.
- Exceptions are now caught when accessing invalid win32 registry keys.
  Updated Graphviz registry key.
  Thanks Andreas Frische for reporting this.
- Fixed templates so that crop code is not inserted when preprocessing the graph.


2.8.6
-----

Released 2009-07-09.

- Added the ``--pgf118`` option for generating code compatible with PGF 1.18 and
  earlier.
- Fixed a bug in handling of the special ``d2toptions`` attribute. It was read
  even when commented out. Thanks Misha Aizatulin for reporting this.
- Fixed label alignment issues when using recent versions of Graphviz.
- Silenced os.popen3 deprecation warning in Python 2.6.
- Fixed bug in handling of d2toption when dot2tex was used as a module.


2.8.5
-----

Released 2009-03-02

- Updated TikZ/PGF templates to use ``line join=bevel`` instead of
  ``join=bevel``. The name of the option was changed in PGF 2.0 and ``join``
  is now used by TikZ's chain library. The change will break PGF 1.18
  compatibility.
- Unquoted unicode strings are now correctly parsed.
    

2.8.4
-----

Released 2008-09-23.

- Fixed a really stupid bug in the quoting of the Graphviz binaries.
  The code in the 2.8.3 release did not quote the binaries at all.
  Thanks Peter Collingbourne for spotting this!

2.8.3
-----

- File paths to the Graphviz executables are now quoted. This solves
  an issue with paths containing spaces. Thanks Pedro Teixeira and
  Mateusz for reporting this.
- Fixed a template typo. Dot2tex looks for the ``<<start_figonlysection>>``,
  but ``<<startfigonlysection>>`` is used in the documentation. Now both
  versions can be used.
- Added ``--cache`` command line option. If caching is enabled, dot2tex
  will check if the input graph has been processed before. If it has
  not changed the graph will not be converted (not documented yet).
      
2.8.2
-----

- Fixed a parsing bug in the detection of output format in cases like::

    dot2tex --preproc example.dot | dot2tex

  Thanks Peter Collingbourne for the patch!
- Removed obsolete shebang line from dot2tex.py


2.8.1
-----

- Fixed a severe bug in the preprocessing code for the tikz output format.

2.8.0
-----

Released 2008-05-05.

- Node names are now filtered to ensure that they are valid TikZ node names.
- Correct fill and stroke color is now set when using the tikz and pst output formats.
- Invisible nodes now generate zero-size coordinates when using the tikz
  output format. This allows drawing edges to/from invisible nodes.
- Added dropshadows.dot and sportsbracket.dot examples.
- Concentrated edges are now supported in the pgf and pstricks output formats.
- The dot parser now correctly parses quoted string like::

    label="A \"quote\""
    label="\n\nA"

- The dot parser now supports concatenation of double quoted strings using
  the + character. Example::

       a [label="partA" + "partB" + "partC"];

- Added support for edge compass points when using the tikz output format.
  Example: ``a.n -> b.e`` is translated to ``\draw (a.north) ... (b.east)``
- The external pydot module has been replaced with a custom version
  of the pydot's dot parser. Available in the dotparsing.py file.
- Added support for file input. If the input data contains the line
  ``\input{filename.dot}``
  filename.dot will be loaded and processed. (Thanks Kim Sullivan for the idea)
- Added interface for using dot2tex as a library. Example::

       import dot2tex
       testgraph="digraph G {a_1-> a_2 -> a_3 -> a_1;}"
       texcode = dot2tex.dot2tex(testgraph,format='tikz',crop=True)


2.7.0
-----

Released 2007-12-10.

- Added the ``--codeonly`` option. When this option is used, only draw
  commands are generated. Intended for use with the dot2texi package.
- Minor improvements to the documentation.
- Added ``graphanndtti.tex`` example.

- Added the ``--autosize`` option. Equivalent to::

  > dot2tex --preproc ex.dot | dot2tex

- Added the ``--prog`` option for choosing between dot, neato, circo, towpi
  and fdp, when the input is in plain dot format.
- Added the special ``d2toptions`` graph attribute. Allows you to specify
  dot2tex options in command line format.
- Added a dot2tex wrapper script and changed setup.py to make it fully
  compatible with both setuptools and distutils. A dot2tex module will
  now be put in the site-packages directory and a wrapper script in the
  scripts directory.
- Fixed typo in error message.
- Added ``--runtests`` option to run doc tests (experimental).
- Fixed issue with wrong template when both  the --preview and --figonly
  options were used.

- Added the ``lblstyle`` attribute for styling graph, node and edge labels.
  (PGF and TikZ only)
- Added the ``--tikzedgelabels`` option for placing edge labels without
  using xdot edge label information (tikz and pgf output format only).
- Added a topath edge attribute for using TikZ' to paths (tikz and
  pgf only).
- Information about the selected output format is now stored in the graph
  generated in preprocessing mode. No longer necessary to specify an
  output format in the final run.
- Edges with the same source and dest are now handled correctly in
  preprocessing mode. Only the edge defined last was preprocessed.
- Added the ``--nodeoptions``  and ``--edgeoptions`` options and corresponding
  ``d2tnodeoptions`` and ``d2tedgeoptions`` graph attribute (tikz only).
- Added the ``exstyle`` attribute. Ignored in preprocessing mode. (pgf and
