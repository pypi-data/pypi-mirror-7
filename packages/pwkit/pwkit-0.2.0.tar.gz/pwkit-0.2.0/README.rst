pwkit: miscellaneous Python for science and astronomy
*****************************************************

This is a collection of Peter Williams’ miscellaneous Python tools. I’m
packaging them so that other people can install them off of PyPI and run my
code without having to go to too much work. That’s the hope, at least.

Peter K. G. Williams and collaborators. Despite this package being named after
me, contributions are welcome and will be given full credit. I just don’t want
to have to make up a decent name for this package right now.
