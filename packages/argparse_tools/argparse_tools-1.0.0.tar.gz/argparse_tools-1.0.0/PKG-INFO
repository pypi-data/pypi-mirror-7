Description: This package wraps argparse to facilitate sharing a standardized set of
        arguments across various scripts and applications that may use argparse.
        
        For example, assume you have two scripts, "runthis.py" and "runthat.py," both
        of which share common arguments.  It may make sense to share the argument logic
        between runthis and runthat.  See the examples directory for an
        implementation of runthis and runthat.
        
        This tool lets you specify default argparse arguments and also lets
        applications override the defaults via the @lazy_kwargs decorator.  See
        examples/shared.py for an example.
