Description: Module nflfan provides a way to connect your fantasy rosters with
        statistical data in nfldb in order to perform live scoring. nflfan also
        provides a simple web interface that can be used to watch all of your
        fantasy games with real time updates. The web server can be started by
        running:
        
        ::
        
            #!bash
            python -m nflfan.web
        
        Currently, only Yahoo and ESPN fantasy leagues are supported. But nflfan
        is extensible, and it will be easy to add more leagues in the future.
