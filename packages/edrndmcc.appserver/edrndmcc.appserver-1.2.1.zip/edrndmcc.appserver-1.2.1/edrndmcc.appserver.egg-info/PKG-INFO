        ******************
        
        This is the policy product for edrndmcc.appserver.  It specifies and
        orchestrates the additional products needed to turn a Plone site into the
        Early Detection Research Network's Data Management and Coordinating Center's
        Application Server.
        
        
        edrndmcc.appserver Installation
        ===============================
        
        Use zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your
        project, and do the following:
        
        * Add ``edrndmcc.appserver`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                edrndmcc.appserver
            
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
            
        You don't need a ZCML slug because it uses z3c.autoinclude.plugin with the
        Plone target.
