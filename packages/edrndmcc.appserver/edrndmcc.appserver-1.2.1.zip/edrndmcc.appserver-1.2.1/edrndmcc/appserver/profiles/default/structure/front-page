<p>Welcome to the Application Server (based on Zope and Plone) for the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) for the Data Management and Coordinating Center. This server hosts web services to support EDRN's mission. Currently, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>EDRN RDF Server</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, the ERNE cache will be migrated to this platform, and future services may be offered here as well.</p>
