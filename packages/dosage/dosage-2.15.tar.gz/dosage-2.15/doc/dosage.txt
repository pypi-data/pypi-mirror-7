NAME
       dosage - a comic strip downloader and archiver

SYNOPSIS
       dosage [options] module...

DESCRIPTION
       dosage  is  an  application  designed to keep a local mirror of
       specific web comics and other picture-based  content,  such  as
       Picture  Of The Day sites, with a variety of options for updat‐
       ing and maintaining collections.

OPTIONS
       -b PATH, --basepath=PATH
              Specifies a base path to put comic  subdirectories.  The
              default is Comics.

       --baseurl=PATH
              Specifies  the base URL for output handlers. The default
              is a local file URI.

       -a, --all
              Traverses all available strips backwards from  the  cur‐
              rent one.  This can be useful you want a full collection
              of a new comic strip, or update an  existing  one  where
              files  are  missing.   Catchups  can start at a specific
              strip by using the index syntax, see  the  INDEX  SYNTAX
              and  SPECIAL  SYNTAX sections for more information. This
              is useful when you missed some days  and  want  only  to
              download the missing files.

       -c, --continue
              Same  as  --all,  but  stop  at the first existing image
              file.  Useful for cron jobs that are not executed  every
              day.

       -h, --help
              Output brief help information.

       -l, --list
              List available comic modules in multi-column fashion.

       --singlelist
              List available comic modules in single-column fashion.

       -m MODULE, --modulehelp=MODULE
              Output module-specific help for MODULE.

       -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
              OUTPUT may be any one of the following:

              html  -  Writes  out  an HTML file linking to the strips
              actually downloaded in the current run,  named  by  date
              (ala  dailystrips).  The  files can be found in the html
              directory of your Comics directory.

              rss - Writes out an RSS feed detailing what strips  were
              downloaded  in  the last 24 hours. The feed can be found
              in Comics/dailydose.xml.

              json - Write a JSON file with all download infos  (URLs,
              images).  Can be used with other scripts, eg. order-sym‐
              links.py to add symbolic links.
       This option can be given multiple times.

       -t, --timestamps
              Print timestamps for all output at any level.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the output level by one with each occurence.

       -V, --version
              Display the version number.

       --vote Vote for the selected comics to  tell  others  that  you
              like  them.   The  sum  of all votes for a comic will be
              displayed  at  the  comic  index  pages  at  http://wum‐
              mel.github.io/dosage/comic-index.html  module  At  least
              one valid module must be specified. A list of valid mod‐
              ules  can  be  found  by passing the -l option. Multiple
              module arguments can be specified on the  command  line.
              Module  names are case insensitive, and it is sufficient
              to specify a unique substring of the module name.

INDEX SYNTAX
       Instead of starting at the latest comic strip,  an  index  lets
       dosage  start at a certain strip. The index can be specified by
       appending a colon : and the index name after the module. Multi‐
       ple comma-spearated indices can also be specified.

       The  index  name  itself usually is the part of the comic strip
       URL that identifiess a strip, eg.  a  number  or  a  date.  The
       expected  format  is  documented  when  using  the --modulehelp
       option.

SPECIAL SYNTAX
       @      This expands to mean all the comics  currently  in  your
              Comics directory. All other specified comic module names
              will be ignored.

       @@     This expands to mean all the comics available to Dosage.

       INDEX SYNTAX can not be used with SPECIAL SYNTAX.

              dosage -a megatokyo

              dosage cyanideandhappiness

              ing URL contents.

NOTES

       retry.  However  the retry information is only outputted in the

       at around 3.0GB.
