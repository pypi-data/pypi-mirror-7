Installation
-------------
The easy way with pip:

```shell
pip install dosage
```

You can invoke Dosage directly from the source code as
`./dosage`. Alternatively,
you can install Dosage using python distutils by invoking
setup.py in the root of the distribution. For example:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

or if you do not have root permissions:

```shell
python setup.py install --home=$HOME
```
