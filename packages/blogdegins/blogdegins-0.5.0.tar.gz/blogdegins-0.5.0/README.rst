==========

Generate static html code with python code files and their
associated Mako templates, css and javascript files,
with a command line utility.

Work with the skeleton you wont.

It includes a skeleton base on:

  * `html5boilerplate <http://html5boilerplate.com/>`_.
  * `jquery <http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page>`_.
  * `Mako <http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
  * `Webassets <http://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
  * `Sass <http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html>`_.
  * `Compass <http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/>`_.

The directories tree is well organized, encouraging to work
with multiple files in development (css, mako, javascript and python).

Separate external lib files and yours own files.

Write the css code in scss language. Use the compass mixins.

In no debug mode, css and javacript files are concatenaded and minified
in only one file.

Generate tags by version, and can synchronize with a server.
