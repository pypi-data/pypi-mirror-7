Bridge between Bitcoin and PostgreSQL.

Coinbridge connects the Bitcoin daemon (bitcoind) and a local PostgreSQL database.  Listens for transaction confirmations and automatically updates a transactions table in your database.

Includes a "payment" method which uses free, instant Bitcoin transfers between accounts in the same wallet, and standard Bitcoin transactions otherwise.  Also includes a comprehensive wrapper for bitcoind/bitcoin-cli JSON-RPC functionality.
