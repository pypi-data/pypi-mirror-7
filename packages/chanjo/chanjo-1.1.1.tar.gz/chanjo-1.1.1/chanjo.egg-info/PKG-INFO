        # Chanjo [![PyPI version][fury-image]][fury-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]
        Coverage analysis for clincal sequencing and beyond (documentation_).
        
        ```shell
        $ cat intervals.bed
        1  10 15 interval-1
        2  45 55 interval-2
        $ cat intervals.bed | chanjo annotate alignment.bam
        #{"sample_id": "bavewira", ...}
        1  10 15 interval-1  9.92231     0.97231
        2  45 55 interval-2  14.23123 1.0
        ```
        
        # Documentation
        The [redesigned documentation](http://www.chanjo.co) has all the information you want; getting started guide, foolproof installation instructions, and in-depth overviews.
        
        I can specifically recommend the fully [interactive demo](http://www.chanjo.co/en/latest/introduction.html#demo), complete with sample data to get you started right away.
        
        # Installation
        Complete instructions are available in the [documentation](http://www.chanjo.co) but installation (*can be*) as simple as running:
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install chanjo
        ```
