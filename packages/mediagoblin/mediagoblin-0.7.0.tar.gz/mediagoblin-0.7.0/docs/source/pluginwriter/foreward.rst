About the Plugin Writer's Guide
===============================

This guide covers writing plugins for GNU MediaGoblin. It's very much
a work in progress partially because we just started writing it and
partially because the plugin API is currently in flux.


Improving the Plugin Writer's Guide
===================================

There are a few ways---please pick whichever method is convenient for
you!

1. Write up a bug report in the bug tracker
2. Tell someone on IRC ``#mediagoblin`` on Freenode.
3. Write an email to the devel mailing list.

Information about the bugtracker, IRC and the mailing list is all on
the `join page`_.

Patches are the most helpful, but even feedback on what you think
could be improved and how to improve it is also helpful.
