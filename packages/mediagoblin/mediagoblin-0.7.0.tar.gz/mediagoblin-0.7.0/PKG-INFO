        What is GNU MediaGoblin?
        ========================
        
        * A place to store all your different media (photos, videos, audios,
          and more!) that’s as awesome as, if not more awesome than, existing
          network services (Flickr, YouTube, etc)
        * Customizable!
        * A place for people to collaborate and show off original and derived
          creations.  Free, as in freedom.  We’re a GNU project after all.
        * Extensible: Plugins allow you to add new media types (3d models?
          Presentations and documents?  Yes, and more!) or extend old ones.
        * A real community, and we'd love to have you join us!

        Yes!

        directory in HTML, Texinfo, and source (Restructured Text) forms.  It's
