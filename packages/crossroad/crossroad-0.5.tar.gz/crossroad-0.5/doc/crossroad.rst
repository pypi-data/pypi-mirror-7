SYNOPSIS
========

In a normal environment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**crossroad** [--help] [--version] [--list-all] [--compress <ARCHIVE.zip> <TARGET 1> [<TARGET 2>...]] [--reset <TARGET 1> [<TARGET 2>...]] [--symlink <TARGET> [<LINK_NAME>]] [<TARGET>]

In a crossroad environment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**crossroad** [--help] [--version] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Crossroad** is a developer tool to prepare your shell environment for Cross-Compilation.

OPTIONS
=======

--version                               Show program's version number and exit
-h, --help                              Show the help message and exit. If a *TARGET* is provided, show information about this platform.
-l, --list-all                          List all known platforms
-c, --compress                          Compress an archive (zip support only), with the given name, of the named platforms.
-s, --symlink                           Create a symbolic link of the named platform.
--reset                                 Effectively delete TARGET's tree. Don't do this if you have important data saved in there.

USAGE AND EXAMPLES
==================

Setting Up
~~~~~~~~~~

`Crossroad` does not need any particular cross-compilation tool to run,
but it will tell you what you are missing, and you won't be able to enter
a cross-compilation environment until this is installed.

List available and unavailable targets with::

    $ crossroad --list-all
    crossroad, version 0.4.4
    Available targets:
    w64                  Windows 64-bit

    Uninstalled targets:
    w32                  Windows 32-bit

In the above example, I can compile for Windows 64-bit, not 32-bit.

To get details about a target's missing dependencies, for instance
Windows 32-bit::

    $ crossroad -h w32
    w32: Setups a cross-compilation environment for Microsoft Windows operating systems (32-bit).

    Not available. Some requirements are missing:
    - i686-w64-mingw32-gcc [package "gcc-mingw-w64-i686"] (missing)
    - i686-w64-mingw32-ld [package "binutils-mingw-w64-i686"]

It will return a list of required binaries that `crossroad` cannot find.
If you actually installed them, the most likely reason is that you should
update your `$PATH` with the right location. In the above example,
`crossroad` could find your minGW linker, but not the compiler. It also
informs you of a possible package name (based on a Linux Mint
distribution. Your distribution may use a different name, but it would
still give a useful hint to search in your package manager).

Install the missing requirements and run crossroad again::

    $ crossroad --list-all
    crossroad, version 0.4.4
    Available targets:
    w32                  Windows 32-bit
    w64                  Windows 64-bit
    $ crossroad -h w32
    w32: Setups a cross-compilation environment for Microsoft Windows operating systems (32-bit).

    Installed language list:
    - C
    Uninstalled language list:
    - Ada                 Common package name providing the feature: gnat-mingw-w64-i686
    - C++                 Common package name providing the feature: g++-mingw-w64-i686
    - OCaml               Common package name providing the feature: mingw-ocaml
    - Objective C         Common package name providing the feature: gobjc++-mingw-w64-i686
    - fortran             Common package name providing the feature: gfortran-mingw-w64-i686

You will notice that now **w32** is available in your list of target, but
also the help is more complete and will also tell you a list of possible
programming languages that MinGW could handle if you installed additional
packages.

*Note: crossroad has actually been tested only with C and C++ projects.
But I welcome any usage report or patch for other languages.*

Optional Step: cleaning any previous cross-compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Crossroad` saves your work state from one use to another, which
allows you to pause a compilation work and continue later. It also means
that your cross-compiled tree will get filled with time. If you start a
new project or want to start from scratch with a clean prefix, reset
your project before you enter it with this optional step:

::

    $ crossroad --reset w64

This is an optional step, and you should not run it if you are actually
expecting to continue where you left `crossroad` the previous time.

**Warning: do not run this --reset if you have important data in your
prefix! Actually you should never have any important data there! It
should only contain your cross-compiled binaries and dependencies.**

Entering a Cross-Compilation Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ crossroad w64

This will set up a Windows 64-bit cross-compilation environment, and 
you will be greeted by a message telling you basics information.

In order for you not to mistake several opened shells, a `crossroad`
prompt will be a modified version of your usual prompt.
A small red ``w64✘`` at the start (only adding information. Whatever
prompt hack you may have made — for instance displaying information of
a code repository — will be untouched) to show you are in your working
cross-compilation environment.
For instance if your prompt is usually `user@host ~/some/path $`, your
`crossroad` prompt will be `w64✘ user@host ~/some/path $`.

*Note: only `bash` and `zsh` are supported right now.*

All necessary environment variables for successful builds, like PATH,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc., are set for you.
Moreover `crossroad` behavior is modified once in a cross-compilation
environment. You can `crossroad -h` or `crossroad help` to see the new
list of commands.

You are now ready to configure and compile any project for your target
platform.

In a crossroad environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-Built Dependency Manager
............................

Once in a crossroad environment, crossroad will behave differently and
have a list of commands.

Display the list of commands with::

    $ crossroad help
    Usage: crossroad [--help] [--version] <command> [<args>]

    Any crossroad environment provides the following commands:
    configure            Run `./configure` in the following directory for your cross-compilation environment.
    cmake                Run cmake for your cross-compilation environment.
    ccmake               Run ccmake for your cross-compilation environment.
    prefix               Return the installation prefix.

    Crossroad's w64 environment proposes the following commands:
    info                 Display package details.
    install              Install the list of packages and all their dependencies.
    list_files           List files provided by packages.
    uninstall            Uninstall packages.

    See `crossroad help <command>` for more information on a specific command.

This specific environment for instance allows you to install various
dependency packages. Let's say your app requires gtk2 and zlib.

First you can see if the pre-built gtk2 version is sufficient::

    $ crossroad info gtk2
    Package "mingw64-gtk2":
            Summary: Library for Creation of Graphical User Interfaces (version 2)
            Project URL: http://www.gtk.org/
            Version: 2.24.18 (release: 2.2 - epoch: 0)
            Description: GTK+ is a highly usable, feature rich toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces which boasts cross platform
                         compatibility and an easy to use API.
                         
                         GTK+ was initially developed for and used by the GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is called the "The GIMP
                         ToolKit" so that the origins of the project are remembered. Today it is more commonly known as GTK+ for short and is
                         used by a large number of applications including the GNU project's GNOME desktop.

You can do the same for zlib and if it suits you, install them::

    $ crossroad install gtk2-devel zlib-devel

All dependencies of these packages will be installed as well.

In case of mistake, you can also uninstall a package with::

    $ crossroad uninstall zlib-devel

If ever `crossroad` dependency manager does not have your required
package, or with inadequate version, you will have to compile it
(see `Build a Project`_ section).

*Note: even though `crossroad` already has a nice built-in dependency
manager, many feature are still missing. In particular there is no
dependency support on uninstall (so be aware you may end up with a
broken prefix when you uninstall carelessly), there is no way to search
packages, there is no track of what you already installed (so you
can endlessly reinstall the same packages).*

Also the package manager will overwrite any file in the crossroad tree.
This is by-design, and you should never consider the crossroad tree as a
safe working place, but rather as a temporary cache of foreign-platform
binaries, which can be erased or moved over to the foreign platform at
any time. In particular keep your code and any working material at your
usual development location.

Currently `crossroad` uses pre-compiled package repositories from the
`Fedora MinGW project`_.
I would welcome any patch to use any other pre-compiled repositories
alongside, provided they are safe.

Build a Project
...............

GNU-style project (autotools)
*****************************

Let's imagine you want to compile any software with a typical GNU
compilation system, for Windows 64-bit.

(1) Enter your source code::

        $ cd /some/path/to/your/source/

(2) Configure your build.

    In a typical GNU code, you should have access to a `./configure`
    script, or with ways to build one, for instance by running an
    `./autogen.sh` first. You should not run it directly, but run it
    though this command instead::

        $ crossroad configure


    There is no need to add a --prefix, a --host, or a --build. These
    are automatically and appropriately set up for you.

    Of course you should still add any other option as you would
    normally do to your `configure` step.
    For instance if your project had a libjpeg dependency that you want to
    deactivate::

        $ crossroad configure --without-libjpeg

    See the `./configure --help` for listing of available options.

(3) If your configure fails because you miss any dependency, you can try
    and install it with the `Pre-Built Dependency Manager`_ or by
    compiling it too.

    Do this step as many times as necessary, until the configure step (2)
    succeeds. Then go to the next step.

(4) Build::

        $ make
        $ make install

(5) All done! Just exit your cross-compilation environment with *ctrl-d*
    or `exit` when you are finished compiling all your programs.

INFO: this has been tested with success on many GNU projects,
cross-compiled for Windows: cairo, babl, GEGL, glib, GTK+, libpng,
pango, freetype2, gdk-pixbuf and GIMP.

CMake Project
*************

Cmake uses toolchain files. Crossroad prepared one for you, so you don't
have to worry about it.
Simply replace the step (2) of the `GNU-style project (autotools)`_
example with this command::

    $ crossroad cmake .

A common cmake usage is to create a build/ directory and build there.
You can do so with crossroad, of course::

    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ crossroad cmake ..

Alternatively crossroad allows also to use the curses interface of
`cmake`::

    $ crossroad ccmake .

The rest will be the same as a normal CMake build, and you can add
any options to your build the usual way.

INFO: This has been tested with success on allegro 5, cross-compiled for
Windows.

Other Build System
******************

It has not been tested with any other compilation system up to now. So
it all depends what they require for a cross-compilation.
But since a `crossroad` environment prepares a bunch of environment
variables for you, and helps you download dependencies, no doubt it will
already make your life easier.

The `configure`, `cmake` and `ccmake` command are simple wrappers around
any normal `./configure` script, and the `cmake` and `ccmake` commands,
adding some default options (which crossroad prepared) for successful
cross-compilation.

For instance `crossroad configure` is the equivalent of running::

    $ ./configure --prefix=$CROSSROAD_PREFIX --host=$CROSSROAD_HOST --build=$CROSSROAD_BUILD

And `crossroad cmake .` is nothing more than::

    $ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$CROSSROAD_PREFIX -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$CROSSROAD_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE

Here is the list of useful, easy-to-remember and ready-to-use,
environment variables, prepared by crossroad:

- $CROSSROAD_PREFIX;

- $CROSSROAD_HOST;

- $CROSSROAD_BUILD;

- $CROSSROAD_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.

- $CROSSROAD_PLATFORM

- $CROSSROAD_PLATFORM_NICENAME

What it means is that you can use these for other compilation systems.
You can also use your `crossroad` prefix, even for systems which do not
require any compilation. Let's say for instance you wish to include a
pure python project in your build. No per-platform compilation is needed,
but you still want to carry all the files in the same prefix for easily
move all together later on.
So just run::

    $ ./setup.py --prefix=$CROSSROAD_PREFIX

and so on.

INFO: as you may have guess `$CROSSROAD_PREFIX` encapsulates your new
cross-build and all its dependencies.
Though in most cases, you should not need to manually go there do
anything, you still can (for instance to change software settings, etc.)
`cd $CROSSROAD_PREFIX`.

WARNING: as said previously in the `Pre-Built Dependency Manager`_ section, do
not perform there or leave any unique work that has not been saved
somewhere else as well.

Import your Project to your Target Platform
............................................

To test your binaries on an actual Windows machine, `crossroad` provides
2 tools.

(1) Make a zip of your whole cross-compiled tree::

        $ crossroad -c mysoftware.zip w64

    This will create a zip file `mysoftware.zip` that you can just move over
    to your test Windows OS. Then uncompress it, and set or update your PATH
    environment variable with the `bin/` directory of this uncompressed
    prefix.

    *Note: only zip format supported for the moment, since it is the most
    common for Windows.*

(2) If you are running Windows in a VM for instance, or are sharing
    partitions, you can just add a symbolic link in a shared directory.
    Just cd to the shared directory and run::

        $ crossroad -s w64 myproject

    This will create a symlink directory named "myproject" linking to
    the "w64" target. Since the directory is shared, it should be
    visible in Windows as a normal directory.


**Finally run your app, and enjoy!**

Configuration
=============

`Crossroad` relies on XDG standards.
Right now it does not need any configuration file, but it may someday.
And these will be in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/crossroad/
(defaults to $HOME/.config/crossroad/).

Cache is saved in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/crossroad/ and cross-compiled data in
$XDG_DATA_HOME/crossroad/.

One of the only configuration right now is that in case you use a
self-installed MinGW-w64 prefix of Windows libraries, if they are not in
the same prefix as the MinGW-64 executables you run, you can set
`$CROSSROAD_CUSTOM_MINGW_W32_PREFIX` and
`$CROSSROAD_CUSTOM_MINGW_W64_PREFIX` respectively for your 32-bit and
64-bit installation of MinGW-w64.  Normally you will not need these. In
most usual installation of MinGW-w64, `crossroad` should be able to
find your Windows libraries prefix.

Also if the environment variable `$CROSSROAD_PS1` is set, it will be
used as your new prompt, instead of constructing a new prompt from the
currently set one.

Contributing
============

You can view the git branch on the web at
http://git.tuxfamily.org/crossroad/crossroad And clone it with::

    $ git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/crossroad/crossroad.git

Then send your `git-format`-ed patches by email to crossroad <at> girinstud.io.

About the name
==============

The name is a hommage to "*cross road blues*" by **Robert Johnson**,
which itself spawned dozens, if not hundreds, of other versions by so
many artists.
I myself always play this song (or rather a version with modified lyrics
adapted to my life) in concerts.
The colored texts when you enter and exits a crossroad are excerpts of
my modified lyrics.
