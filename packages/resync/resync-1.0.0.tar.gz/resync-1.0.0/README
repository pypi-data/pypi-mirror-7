**resync** is a ResourceSync client and library in python. `ResourceSync 
<http://www.openarchives.org/rs/>`_ is a synchronization framework for 
the web consisting of various capabilities that allow third party 
systems to remain synchronized with a server's evolving resources. 
The capabilities can be combined in a modular manner to meet local 
or community requirements.

Client usage
------------

Typical client usage to synchronize from a source at 
``http://source.example.com/`` to a set of local files would be::

    resync http://source.example.com/

which will create or update a local directory ``./source.example.com``. 
Alternatively, the destination directory may be specified explicitly::

    resync http://source.example.com/ /tmp/my_copy

Option details and a number of different modes are described with::

    resync -h

Library usage
-------------

Typical library use in a source (create and output a Resource List)::

    from resync import Resource,ResourceList

    rl = ResourceList()
    rl.add( Resource('http://example.com/res1', lastmod='2013-01-01') )
    rl.add( Resource('http://example.com/res2', lastmod='2013-01-02') )
    print rl.as_xml()

Typical library use in a destination (get and examine a Capability List):: 

    from resync import CapabilityList

    # Read Capability List and show supported capabilities
    cl = CapabilityList()
    cl.read("https://raw.github.com/resync/resync/1.0/resync/test/testdata/examples_from_spec/resourcesync_ex_2_6.xml")
    for resource in cl:
        print "supports %s (at %s)" % (resource.capability,resource.uri)

Installation
------------

The client and library are designed to work with Python 2.6 or 2.7.

**Automatic installation**::

    easy_install resync

rsync is listed in `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/resync>`_ and can be installed with 
``pip`` or ``easy_install``. 

**Manual installation from github**::

    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/resync/resync.git
    cd resync/
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

This will install the library code in the appropriate place within 
your python setup, and the client ``resync`` in an appropriate system 
path (perhaps ``/usr/local/bin`` or ``/usr/bin`` depending on your system).

The source code is maintained on `Github
<https://github.com/resync/resync>`_
and there may be branches/versions available there that are not 
yet packaged for `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/resync>`_.
