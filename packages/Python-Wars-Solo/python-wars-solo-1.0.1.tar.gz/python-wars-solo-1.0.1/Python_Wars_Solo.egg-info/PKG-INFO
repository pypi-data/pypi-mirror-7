        Introduction
        ============
        
        Python Wars Solo is the result of a few hours effort roughly duplicating a text-based Star Trek game I wrote back in 1980-1981.  You fought up to 9 Klingons in your Enterprise.  Beating one was a piece of cake.  Three was a fun challenge.  Five was tough.  Seven was done only a few times.  Nine was never done.  The game was simple, fast, easy to learn, and tons of fun.
        
        Now I don't remember much about the mechanics of the code I wrote back in High School.  So when I started writing Python Wars Solo I decided not to worry about it.  I would code how I felt like coding, and just create a game.
        
        There were a few false starts.  I kept trying to add tons of complexity to the code, or lots of neat features.  Lots of time was wasted and not much was done.  The technical term for what I was doing is 'Scope Creep'.  Then someone advised that I just make it really simple and get it done.
        
        And I did.  I got it done.
        
        To avoid potential yet likely silly copyright/trademark issues, I renamed the ship the '*Pythonista*'.  The enemies are the evil '*Zargons*'.

         * Fight the good fight against the evil Zargons
         * Use your ship's spinal mounted beam cannon to slice and dice the enemy to pieces!
         * Launch missiles to destroy Zargons in single shots
         * Fight up to 9 enemies!
         * Old school text based game
         * Easy to learn
         * Addictive
        
        Future Version Thoughts
        ========================
        
        Originally I thought of expanding this out to become a game with graphics and maybe a campaign. Then I went onto other things. But here was my original list of things to add:
         
         * Keep basic mechanics
         * Add 2-D map
         * Incorporate PyGame
         * Since all components are objects on ship objects which exist in the space object, current version could easily be expanded:
         * Let players build their own ships and use introspection to generate menus
         * Damage the ship in ways so that parts get broken
