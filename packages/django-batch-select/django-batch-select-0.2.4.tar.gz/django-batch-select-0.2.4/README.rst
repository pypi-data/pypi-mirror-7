Django Batch Select
===================

The idea of Django Batch Select is to provide an equivalent to
Django's select_related_ functionality.  As of such it's another handy
tool for avoiding the "n+1 query problem".

select_related_ is handy for minimizing the number of queries that need
to be made in certain situations.  However it is only usual for
pre-selecting ForeignKey_ relations.

batch_select is handy for pre-selecting ManyToManyField_ relations and
reverse ForeignKey_ relations.

It works by performing a single extra SQL query after a QuerySet_ has
been evaluated to stitch in the the extra fields asked for.  This requires
the addition of a custom Manager_, which in turn returns a custom QuerySet_
with extra methods attached.

Example Usage
=============

Assuming we have models defined as the following::

    from batch_select.models import BatchManager

    class Tag(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=32)

    class Section(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=32)

        objects = BatchManager()

    class Entry(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        section = models.ForeignKey(Section, blank=True, null=True)
        tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag)

        objects = BatchManager()

I'll also define a helper function to show the SQL queries generated::

    from django import db

    def show_queries():
        for query in db.connection.queries:
            print query["sql"]
        db.reset_queries()

Here are a few example (with generated sql queries)::

    >>> Entry.objects.batch_select('tags').all()
    []
    >>> show_queries() # no results, so no 2nd query
    SELECT "batch_select_entry"."id", "batch_select_entry"."title", "batch_select_entry"."section_id" FROM "batch_select_entry"
    >>> Entry.objects.create()
    >>> Entry.objects.create()
    >>> tag1 = Tag.objects.create(name='tag1')
    >>> tag2 = Tag.objects.create(name='tag2')
    >>> db.reset_queries()
    >>> entries = Entry.objects.batch_select('tags').all()
    >>> entry = entries[0]
    >>> print entry.tags_all
    []
    >>> show_queries()
    SELECT "batch_select_entry"."id", "batch_select_entry"."title", "batch_select_entry"."section_id" FROM "batch_select_entry" LIMIT 1
    SELECT (`batch_select_entry_tags`.`entry_id`) AS "entry_id", "batch_select_tag"."id", "batch_select_tag"."name" FROM "batch_select_tag" INNER JOIN "batch_select_entry_tags" ON ("batch_select_tag"."id" = "batch_select_entry_tags"."tag_id") WHERE "batch_select_entry_tags".entry_id IN (1)
    >>> entry.tags.add(tag1)
    >>> db.reset_queries()
    >>> entries = Entry.objects.batch_select('tags').all()
    >>> entry = entries[0]
    >>> print entry.tags_all
    [<Tag: Tag object>]
    >>> show_queries()
    SELECT "batch_select_entry"."id", "batch_select_entry"."title", "batch_select_entry"."section_id" FROM "batch_select_entry" LIMIT 1
    SELECT (`batch_select_entry_tags`.`entry_id`) AS "entry_id", "batch_select_tag"."id", "batch_select_tag"."name" FROM "batch_select_tag" INNER JOIN "batch_select_entry_tags" ON ("batch_select_tag"."id" = "batch_select_entry_tags"."tag_id") WHERE "batch_select_entry_tags".entry_id IN (1)
    >>> entries = Entry.objects.batch_select('tags').all()
    >>> for entry in entries:
    ....     print entry.tags_all
    ....
    [<Tag: Tag object>]
    []
    >>> show_queries()
    SELECT "batch_select_entry"."id", "batch_select_entry"."title", "batch_select_entry"."section_id" FROM "batch_select_entry"
    SELECT (`batch_select_entry_tags`.`entry_id`) AS "entry_id", "batch_select_tag"."id", "batch_select_tag"."name" FROM "batch_select_tag" INNER JOIN "batch_select_entry_tags" ON ("batch_select_tag"."id" = "batch_select_entry_tags"."tag_id") WHERE "batch_select_entry_tags".entry_id IN (1, 2)

Re-running that same last for loop without using batch_select
generate three queries instead of two (n+1 queries)::

    >>> entries = Entry.objects.all()
    >>> for entry in entries:
    ....     print entry.tags.all()
    ....
    [<Tag: Tag object>]
    []

    >>> show_queries()
    SELECT "batch_select_entry"."id", "batch_select_entry"."title", "batch_select_entry"."section_id" FROM "batch_select_entry"
    SELECT "batch_select_tag"."id", "batch_select_tag"."name" FROM "batch_select_tag" INNER JOIN "batch_select_entry_tags" ON ("batch_select_tag"."id" = "batch_select_entry_tags"."tag_id") WHERE "batch_select_entry_tags"."entry_id" = 1
    SELECT "batch_select_tag"."id", "batch_select_tag"."name" FROM "batch_select_tag" INNER JOIN "batch_select_entry_tags" ON ("batch_select_tag"."id" = "batch_select_entry_tags"."tag_id") WHERE "batch_select_entry_tags"."entry_id" = 2

This also works with reverse foreign keys. So for example we can get
this entries that belong to each section::

    >>> section1 = Section.objects.create(name='section1')
    >>> section2 = Section.objects.create(name='section2')
    >>> Entry.objects.create(section=section1)
    >>> Entry.objects.create(section=section1)
    >>> Entry.objects.create(section=section2)
    >>> db.reset_queries()
    >>> Section.objects.batch_select('entry_set')
    [<Section: Section object>, <Section: Section object>]
    >>> show_queries()
    SELECT "batch_select_section"."id", "batch_select_section"."name" FROM "batch_select_section" LIMIT 21
    SELECT ("batch_select_entry"."section_id") AS "__section_id", "batch_select_entry"."id", "batch_select_entry"."title", "batch_select_entry"."section_id", "batch_select_entry"."location_id" FROM "batch_select_entry" WHERE "batch_select_entry"."section_id" IN (1, 2)

Each section object in that query will have an entry_set_all field
containing the relevant entries.

You need to pass batch_select the "related name" of the foreign key,
in this case "entry_set". NB by default the related name for a foreign
key does not actually include the _set suffix, so you can use just "entry"
in this case. I have made sure that the _set suffix version also works to
try and keep the API simpler.


More Advanced Usage
=========================

By default the batch fields are inserted into fields named ``<name>_all``,
on each object.  So::

    Entry.objects.batch_select('tags').all()

results in the Entry instances having fields called ``'tags_all'``
containing the Tag objects associated with that Entry.

If you want to give the field a different name just use a keyword
argument - in the same way as using the Aggregation_ API::

    Entry.objects.batch_select(selected_tags='tags').all()

Would means the Tag objects would be assigned to fields called
``'selected_tags'``.

If you want to perform filtering of the related objects you will need to
use a Batch object. By doing this you can pass extra keyword arguments
in the same way as when using the filter method of a QuerySet::

    from batch_select.models import Batch

    Entry.objects.batch_select(tags_containing_blue=Batch('tags', name__contains='blue'))

Would return Entry objects with fields called 'tags_containing_name' with
only those Tags whose name contains 'blue'.

In addition to filtering using keyword arguments, you can also call the
following methods on a Batch object, with their effects being passed on
to the underlying QuerySet_ object:

* filter_
* exclude_
* annotate_
* order_by_
* reverse_
* select_related_
* extra_
* defer_
* only_
* batch_select

(Note that distinct(), values() etc are not included as they would have
side-effects on how the extra query is associated with the original query)
So for example to achieve the same effect as the filter above you could
do the following::

    from batch_select.models import Batch

    Entry.objects.batch_select(tags_containing_blue=Batch('tags').filter(name__contains='blue'))

Whereas the following would exclude tags containing "blue" and order by name::

    from batch_select.models import Batch

    batch = Batch('tags').exclude(name__contains='blue').order_by('name')
    Entry.objects.batch_select(tags_not_containing_blue=batch)


Compatibility
=============

Django batch select should work with Django 1.1-1.3 at least.
