 1 Packages And Archives

 AdvaS is available as a tar.gz archive. The latest version can be
 retrieved from
 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/advas
    
 2 Supported Operating Systems / Requirements

 Advas should run on any more recent i386-compatible machine using 
 GNU/Linux, UNIX or FreeBSD. Specific changes for other OS are to be done.
 Advas is written in python (http://www.python.org) and requires at
 least the python 2 libraries and interpreter to be installed.

 Currently, advas needs about 4 Mbytes of disc space including documentation
 and examples.

 3 How To Install

 Advas is designed be used as an additional python module. 

 1) Download the latest version and copy the archive in a directory of 
    your choice. 

 2) tar.gz archive:
    Unzip and untar the archive using

    tar -xzf advas-x.x.x.tar.gz

    whereas x.x.x represents the current AdvaS version.

    As a result, a new directory will be created ("advas-x.x.x"). This
    directory contans the advas library as well as this documentation.

 3) That's all - now advas is ready to work :-)
