Description: TheHerk Resources
        =================
        
        TheHerk Resources is a Django application for keeping track of and referencing resources like organizations and people (for now).
        
        Each allows the addition of many contact types with a very straightforward admin interface.
        
        It also includes Django-cms plugins for displaying the data in a few different ways.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Add "resources" and "localflavor" to your INSTALLED_APPS
        
                INSTALLED_APPS = (
                    ...
                    'localflavor',
                    'resources',
                )
        
        2. Run `python manage.py migrate resources`.
