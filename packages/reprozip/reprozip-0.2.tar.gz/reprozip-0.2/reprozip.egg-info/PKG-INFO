Description: ReproZip is a tool aimed at scientists using Linux distributions, that
        simplifies the process of creating reproducible experiments from programs.
        
        It uses the ptrace facilities of Linux to trace the processes and files that
        are part of the experiment and build a comprehensive provenance graph for the
        user to review.
        
        Then, it can pack these files in a package to allow for easy reproducibility
        elsewhere, either by unpacking and running on a compatible machine or by
        creating a virtual machine through Vagrant.
        
        This package holds the tracer and packer components (and the 'reprozip'
        command-line utility).
