OpenDiscovery
========================

Version: 2.4.2

Introduction
------------

Open Discovery is a suite of programs that use Open Source or freely
available tools to dock a library of chemical compounds against a
receptor protein. In a paper in the Journal of Chemical Education, we
outline the usefulness of having an uncomplicated, free-to-use protocol
to accomplish a task that has been the subject of academic and
commercial interest for decades [1]. We also highlight the gaps in open
source tools around preparing protein - ligand complexes for molecular
simulation, an area we expect to develop in the future.

Requirements
------------

-  Open Babel (install from http://openbabel.org/ - version developed
   with: 2.3.1). Open Babel is used for file conversions.
