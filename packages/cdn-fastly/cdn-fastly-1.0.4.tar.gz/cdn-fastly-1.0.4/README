# Create a new version of the service.
service_version = client.create_service_version(service.id,
	comment="A new version of this service.")

# Create a domain.

	service_version.number,
	"www.test.com",
	comment="A new domain.")

# List domains associated with this version.
print client.list_domains(service.id, service_version.number)

# Delete the domain we just created.
client.delete_domain(service.id, service_version.number, domain.name)
