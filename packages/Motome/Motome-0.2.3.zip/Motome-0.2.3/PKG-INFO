        ===========
        
        Motome is a note taking and information aggregation application inspired
        by many other note taking programs.
        
        Some of its features are:
        
        -  Note search and creation from a single input
        -  Markdown rendering
        -  History tracking and the ability to see diffs
        -  Note tagging
        -  Auto-saves notes in the background
        -  Keyboard shortcuts
        -  Local storage and link to any file type
        -  Drag and drop files to create links
        
        The motivation behind Motome:
        
        -  Notes are yours and stored where you want them
        -  Notes are stored in easily accessible text files, not in a database
           or inaccessible format
        -  Notes can have histories
        -  Notes can be more than just text by including additional data files
           like images, pdfs, spreadsheets, and rich text documents (the
           inspiration for this comes from bigger note taking apps like Evernote
           and OneNote)
        
        Motome is developed with `Python`_ and `Qt`_ and is cross platform.
