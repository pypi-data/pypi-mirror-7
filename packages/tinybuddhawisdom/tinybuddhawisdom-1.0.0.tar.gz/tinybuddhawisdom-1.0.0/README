# tinybuddha-wisdom

The [Tiny Buddha](http://www.tinybuddha.com) wisdoms for your shell. Thanks Lori (the author) for granting the use of her site in such nerdy way :). Compatible with Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Add it to your shell startup configuration and everytime you login or spawn a shell you'll be greeted with the latest wisdom quote. 

## Example

<pre>
Tiny Buddha: “Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, 
and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.” 
-John Allen Paulos
localhost :: ~ % 
</pre>

## Installation

Add the following line to your e.g. .zshrc, .bashrc. It depends which shell you're actually using.   

<pre>
$ cd ~
$ git clone git://github.com/jpzk/tinybuddha-wisdom.git
</pre>

and then install tinybuddha-wisdom with setup.py

<pre>
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

now you can simply run the program 'tinybuddha' or add it to your shell startup file

<pre>
$ tinybuddha
Tiny Buddha: "He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away." ~Raymond Hull
