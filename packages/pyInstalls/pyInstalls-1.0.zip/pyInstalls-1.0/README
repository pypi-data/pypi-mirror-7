===========

pyInstalls helps Windows users who can't use any of the automated tools to install new modules (pip, easy_install). 
If you're at work and behind a proxy, even after configuring your proxy you still may have trouble installing modules (I know I do, it always fails to download).
What I normally have to do is download the package (zip, tar, .gz), unpack it, open a cmd propmt, cd to that folder and then; python setup.py install

pyInstall does all of this for you. When you isntall pyInstall it will create a cmd file and place it in your '~\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo' folder which adds it to your right click menu.

After installing, download a specific package you want, right click on it, click 'Send-To' then select installer.cmd. The cmd file will then send the path of the file you selected to the pyInstalls module inside your site-packages folder which will unpack and install for you.
