    get_command_alias_help looks for help not description. Otherwise you
    see:

    Fix comments command wrt change in OperationQuery constructor
    The comments command relied on the 'patches' arg to OperationQuery
    having a fixed position. This changed when the 'rawquery' arg was
    added, so fix by using a named parameter instead.
    
    
    
2014-05-01 Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
    
    Improve error reporting when commands fail
    Previously we'd only return a single line from stderr when
    a command fails. This made it hard to diagnose some SSH

    stderr.

2014-04-16 Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
    
    Add '--current' and '--patch' flags to "comment" command

    CommandCaching -> CommandReport -> CommandProject
    
    switch to use multiple inheritance. ie subclasses will
    decide exactly which of these 3 parent classes they wish
    to use. This allows reuse of the CommandProject class
    for things which are not reports or which dont want to
    be cached.
    
    
    
2014-04-16 Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
    
    Change to super(ClassName, self) syntax for parent invocation

    where as others can only be cached a short time (5 minutes)
    
    
    
2014-04-14 Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
    
    Add some scripts for reporting on todoo lists
    Add four "todo list" scripts / reports

    more generic.

    Fix detection of error response from gerrit

    key called 'error'.
    
    
    
2014-04-14 Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
    
    Fix bogus status constants for open/closed
    It isn't possible to query open/closed status by using a

    Add ability to purge the cache of json docs
    
    
2014-04-11 Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>
    
    Improve cacheability of patch review stats data
    Instead of query data for all projects at once, query each
    project in turn. This means that if the command is re-run
    multiple times with different, overlapping, project sets
    then we hit the cache more frequently.

    Allow multi-level override of cli options from config
    Add a '--profile NAME' flag which allows you to configure
    multiple different profiles for each command. So for a
    tool 'foo#, first look for defaults in a config section
    'command:foo:$PROFILE', then look in 'command:foo'
