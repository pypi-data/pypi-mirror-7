Description: If you use a central repository manager such as gitolite
        or gitosis you probably have at least a few repositories using custom git
        hooks.
        
        Managing the hooks in all your repositories by hand, is time consuming
        and prone to error. If you need to take advantage of the functionality
        provided by more than one hook script you are left to do it yourself.
        
        cpthook allows you to run more than one hook in each repo and manage
        them all in one location.
