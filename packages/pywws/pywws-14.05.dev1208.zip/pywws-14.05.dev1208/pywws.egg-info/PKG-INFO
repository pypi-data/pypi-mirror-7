Description: 
        A collection of Python scripts to read, store and process data from
        popular USB wireless weather stations such as Elecsa AstroTouch 6975,
        Watson W-8681, WH-1080PC, WH1080, WH1081, WH3080 etc. I assume any
        model that is supplied with the EasyWeather Windows software is
        compatible, but cannot guarantee this.
        
        The software has been developed to run in a low power, low memory
        environment such as a router. It can be used to create graphs and web
        pages showing recent weather readings, typically updated every hour.
