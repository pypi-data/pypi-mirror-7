        A component can be any Python object.

        key is a hashable object that is used to determine what to
        look up. Normally it is a Python function.

        args is a list of 0 to n objects that we use to look up the
        component. The classes of the args are used to do the look
        up. If multiple args are listed, the lookup is made for that
        combination of args.

        If the component found is an instance of class:`Matcher`, it
        will be called with args as parameters
        (``matcher(*args)``). The matcher can return an object, in
        which case will be returned as the real matching component. If
        the matcher returns ``None`` it will look for a match higher
        up the ancestor chain of args. If a ``predicates`` argument is
        supplied this is used by the matcher instead of doing its own
        predicate calculation from the arguments. This can be useful
        in combination with the :class:`reg.PredicateMatcher` to
        override which predicates are used in a lookup.

        If a component can be found, it will be returned. If the
        component cannot be found, a :class:`ComponentLookupError`
