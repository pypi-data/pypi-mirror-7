Description: A Python package for creating, modifying, and writing Cadsoft EAGLE files
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        For writing EAGLE files, the non-standard Python package lxml is required:
        
        	http://lxml.de/
        	
        This can be installed using pip:
        
        ::
        
        	pip install lxml 
        
        If lxml is not available (for example, with IronPython), it is still possible to read EAGLE files, but it is not possible to write EAGLE files. 
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install, use pip:
        
        ::
        
        	pip install eaglepy
        
        The source code (with examples) is available from the GitHub repository:
        
        	https://github.com/richard-clark/eaglepy
        
        The package can be installed from the source directory by invoking
        
        ::
        
        	python setup.py install
        	
        from the source directory.
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        As a basic example, the following will create (and save) an empty schematic:
        
        ::
        
        	from eaglepy import default_layers, eagle
        
        	schematic_path = 'schematic.sch'
        
        	schematic = eagle.Schematic(sheets = [eagle.Sheet()])
        
        	drawing = eagle.Drawing(grid = eagle.Grid(),
        		layers = default_layers.get_layers(),
        		document = schematic)
        
        	e = eagle.Eagle(drawing)
        
        	e.save(schematic_path)
        
        There are a number of example modules provided in the GitHub repository.
