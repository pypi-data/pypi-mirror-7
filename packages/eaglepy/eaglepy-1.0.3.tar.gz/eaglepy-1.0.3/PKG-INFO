Description: EAGLE-Python
        ============
        
        A Python package for creating, modifying, and writing Cadsoft EAGLE files
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        For writing EAGLE files, the non-standard Python package [lxml] is required. This can be installed using pip:
        
        	pip install lxml 
        
        If lxml is not available (for example, with IronPython), it is still possible to read EAGLE files, but it is not possible to write EAGLE files. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The package can be installed by cloning into the repository and then invoking
        ``setup.py`` from the source directory:
        
        	python setup.py install
        	
        This package is also avilable on the [Python Package Index][ppi], and can be installed using pip:
        
        	pip install eaglepy
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        As a basic example, the following will create (and save) an empty schematic:
        
        	from eaglepy import default_layers, eagle
        
        	schematic_path = 'schematic.sch'
        
        	schematic = eagle.Schematic(sheets = [eagle.Sheet()])
        
        	drawing = eagle.Drawing(grid = eagle.Grid(),
        		layers = default_layers.get_layers(),
        		document = schematic)
        
        	e = eagle.Eagle(drawing)
        
        	e.save(schematic_path)
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        More extensive documentation is available [here][doc].
        
        
        There are a number of example modules provided in the ``examples/`` directory.
