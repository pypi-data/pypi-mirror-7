Instakit<sup><b>†</b></sup> is a suite of image processors and filters, for processing PIL images.

InstaKit processors use the same API as [PILKit](https://github.com/matthewwithanm/pilkit)'s,
so they can be used with anything that supports those, including [ImageKit](https://github.com/matthewwithanm/django-imagekit).
Or you can just use them by themselves to process images using Python.

As of this first draft there are [Instagrammy](http://www.instagram.com/) image-curve adjusters and a few other geegaws.
