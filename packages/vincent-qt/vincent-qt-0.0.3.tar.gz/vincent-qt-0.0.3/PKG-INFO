Description: Vincent-Qt
        ==========
        The folks at Trifacta are making it easy to build visualizations on top of D3 with Vega. Vincent makes it easy to build Vega with Python. Vincent-Qt makes it easy to use Vincent in QtWidgets applications.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        .. code:: sh
        
           $ pip install vincent_qt
        
        Usage
        -----
        Create `QWebView` object, plot something with Vincent then call function display:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
           import vincent_qt
           web_view = QWebView()
           plot = vincent.Line(data)
           vincent_qt.display(web_view, plot)
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        Internet connection
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        You need to have internet connection at least for the first run of application. Vincent-Qt uses JS scripts from the interne to plot. By default it caches them in `.vega-cache` dir inside your application dir.
        
        Blinking
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        This library is web-based, so when you `display` new plot on `QWebView` widget, it loads web page. Because of that firstly it clears it's content, then it displays your plot. That process causes blinking. It's probably OK when you plot occasionally, but it's disgusting in realtime plotting. If you use `PyQt4` or `PySide` you can try `PyQtGraph`.
