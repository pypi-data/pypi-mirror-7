        Installing
        ----------
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install describe-it
        
        Writing
        -------
        Any module that ends with 'spec' is considered to contain specifications/tests
        for describe_it.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ vim myfirst_spec.py
        
        ...and the content:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from game import Game
            from describe_it import describe, it, before_each, Fixture
        
            @describe
            def a_game():
                f = Fixture()
        
                @before_each
                def setup():
                    f.game = Game()
        
                @after_each
                def teardown():
                    # This should rarely be needed!
                    perform_post_test_cleanup_if_needed()
        
                @it
                def is_player_ones_turn():
                    assert f.game.current_player == 1
        
                @describe
                def in_second_round():
        
                    @before_each
                    def setup():
                        f.game.play_round()
        
                    @it
