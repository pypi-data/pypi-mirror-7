## DBSCAN Algorithm
Uncheck the checkbox in case you prefer to define your own parameters for this algorithm.
In this case you will have to define two lists of parameters (eps and minpts) that will form pairs. This means that
both lists must have the same number of elements.
Example:
If you defined Eps to be:
    2.1, 3.4, 6.0
and Minpts:
    13, 23, 27

This means you're indeed defining this parameter pairs:
    (2.1,13) , (3.4, 23) ,  (6.0, 27)
