## Adding (PDB) trajectories to your project
Here you will define which are the trajectories you want to work with. pyProCT can work with more than one trajectory at the same time, but all trajectories must be "*.pdb*" files.

Use the trajectories widget to add or delete trajectories:


- The *Add* button will spawn a simple browser to help you select a "*.pdb*" trajectory file. 
- Select one or more trajectories with your mouse to delete them using the *Remove* button.
