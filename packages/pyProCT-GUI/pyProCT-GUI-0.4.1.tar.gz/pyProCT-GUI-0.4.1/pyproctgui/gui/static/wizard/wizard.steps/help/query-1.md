##Adding queries 
A query is any value derived from the clusterings you generate, as the number of elements it has, the noise or any of the predefined
Internal Validation Indexes (such as Rand Index, Separation, etc). All queries will be calculated for all of the clusters selected
from the clustering-space exploration step.  
Use the list controls to add or remove queries:  
- The *Add* button will add the currently selected query in the drop-down list. 
- Select one or more queries with your mouse to delete them using the *Remove* button.
