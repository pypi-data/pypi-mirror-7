## Defining your hipotesis (I)

Use this screen to define your clustering hypothesis (in other words, to describe how you expect/desire the resulting clustering to be).
Here you will be able to define how much noise you will allow (the percentage of non-clustered elements), how small your clusters can
be before being considered noise, and a minimum and maximum number of clusters your clustering can have.
