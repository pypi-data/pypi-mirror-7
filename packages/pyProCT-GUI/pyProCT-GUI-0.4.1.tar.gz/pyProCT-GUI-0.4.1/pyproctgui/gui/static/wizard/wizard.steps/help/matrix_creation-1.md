## Type of matrix

Use this screen to choose which kind of matrix you want to build. You have two options depending on the distance function used:  
- A Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) matrix.  
- An euclidean distance matrix.  
- Loading a precalculated matrix (if you want to use a distance function different than the ones above.)
