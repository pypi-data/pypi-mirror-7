## Defining a workspace
Write the path of the folder you want to use to store your pyProCT's project files. It it does not exist, pyProCT will try to create it.  
The workspace folder is a safe place where pyProCT can create and destroy files and folders. This means that if the folder already
exists it is better to erase all its contents and not to modify any of its files while pyProCT is running a clustering job.  
The "*results*" folder will be created in this location so that you can later review the results using this GUI.
