        Use case
        ---------
        
        A college with descentralized content management and groups dedicated to research. Each group should manage its own content.
        
        In their portal they want to host areas for each research group they sponsor.
        All those areas will be under the folder /research/. A research group called
        "Environmental Studies" will have an area at /research/environmental-studies.
        
        Every time a new research group is added under /research/ they need to create at
        least two user groups:
        
        * Editors: Group of users responsible for publishing content and managing
          this area.
        
        * Members: Group of users with access to this area.
        
        Also, every time a research group is removed from /research/ they want to remove
        existing user groups related to it.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.contentrules.group``
           to the list of eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...

        group, other to remove an existing user group.
        
        Create User Group

        Group Id
            Unique name for the newly created group. You are allowed to use ${title} in
            here to dinamically generate the id for the group. i.e.: If this field have
            a value of **${title} Editors** and the action is being executed for a
            folder with title "Environmental Studies", Group Id will be
            "Environmental Studies Editors"
        
        Group Title
            Friendly name for the newly created group. You are allowed to use ${title}
            in here to dinamically create the id for the group. i.e.: If this field
            have a value of **Editors for Research Group: ${title}** and the action is
            being executed for a folder with title "Environmental Studies", Group Title
            will be "Editors for Research Group: Environmental Studies"
        
        Roles
            Global roles for newly created group. Roles selected here will be effective
            in the whole portal.
        
        .. note:: In order to apply a local role -- set a role for the newly created
                  group only in the object that triggered the content rule -- you need
                  to have the **sc.contentrules.localrole** package installed and use
                  the package's provided action.
        
        
        Remove User Group

        Group Id
            Id of the group to be removed. You are allowed to use ${title} in
            here to dinamically generate the id for the group. i.e.: If this field have
            a value of **${title} Editors** and the action is being executed for a
            folder with title "Environmental Studies", Group Id will be
