structlog makes structured logging in Python easy by *augmenting* your *existing* logger.
It allows you to split your log entries up into key/value pairs and build them incrementally without annoying boilerplate code.

structlog targets Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and PyPy with no additional dependencies for core functionality.
