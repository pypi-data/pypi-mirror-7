Changelog
=========

2.1.2 (2014-04-25)
------------------

Fix
~~~

- Fail with error message when config path exists but is not a file.
  (fixes #11) [Casey Duquette]

  For example, the config file could be a directory.

2.1.1 (2014-04-15)
------------------

Fix
~~~

- Removed exception if you had file which name that matched a tag's
  name. (fixes #9) [Valentin Lab]

2.1.0 (2014-03-25)
------------------

New
~~~

- Python3 compatibility. [Valentin Lab]

- Much greater performance on big repository by issuing only one shell
  command for all the commits. (fixes #7) [Valentin Lab]

- Add ``init`` argument to create a full ``.gitchangelog.rc`` in current
  git repository. [Valentin Lab]

- Remove optional first argument that could specify the target git
  repository to consider. [Valentin Lab]

  This is to remove duplicate way to do things. ``gitchangelog`` should
  be run from within a git repository.  Any usage of ``gitchangelog
  MYREPO`` can be written ``(cd MYREPO; gitchangelog)``.

- Use a standard formatting configuration by default. [Valentin Lab]

  A default `standard` way of formatting is used if you don't provide
  any configuration file. Additionaly, any option you define in your
  configuration file will be added "on-top" of the default configuration
  values. This can reduce config file size or even remove the need of
  one if you follow the standard.  And, thus, you can tweak the standard
  for your needs by providing only partial configuration file. See tests
  for examples.

- Remove user or system wide configuration file lookup. [Valentin Lab]

  This follows reflexion that you build a changelog for a repository and
  that the rules to make the changelog should definitively be explicit
  and thus belongs to the repository itself.  Not a justification, but
  removing user and system wide configuration files also greatly
  simplifies testability.

Fix
~~~

- Encoding issues with non-ascii chars. [Valentin Lab]

- Avoid using pipes for windows compatibility and be more performant by
  avoiding to unroll full log to get the last commit. [Valentin Lab]

- Better support of exotic features of git config file format. (fixes
  #4) [Valentin Lab]

  git config file format allows ambiguous keys:      [a "b.c"]         d
  = foo     [a.b "c"]         e = foo     [a.b.c]         f = foo  Are
  all valid. So code was simplified to use directly ``git config``. This
  simplification will deal also with cases where section could be
  attributed values:      [a "b"]         c = foo     [a]         b =
  foo  By avoiding to parse the entire content of the file, and relying
  on ``git config`` implementation we ensure to remain compatible and
  not re-implement the parsing of this file format.

- Gitchangelog shouldn't fail if it fails to parse your git config.
  [Michael Hahn]

  Lab]

~~~
