Install pybdf
***************

To install pybdf you will need:
 - python 
 - numpy 
 - a fortran compiler

On all platforms, after having unpacked the archive
you can install pybdf by running::

    python setup.py install

Note that pybdf has been built and tested only on Linux with Python3. I don't have
enhough time to build and test binaries for Windows and Mac OS X, but if
you try, please let me know how you get on with it.
