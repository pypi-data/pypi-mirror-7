Description: Carinata is a command line tool which transforms spec files into unittest cases.
        It tries to be a bit like RSpec, but for python. It includes a management
        command for Django.
        
        Spec files contain blocks called ``describe``, ``context``, ``before``, ``after``,
        ``let`` and ``it``, which in turn contain pure python. Carinata uses these blocks
        to create a ``TestCase`` corresponding to each ``it`` block, with the setup from
        ``before`` and ``let`` and the teardown from ``after``.
        
        See the `project homepage`_ on GitHub for more information, but here is an example::
        
            describe "My Awesome class":
                context "with the number 42":
                    let "awesome": Awesome(42)
        
                    it "jumps for joy":
                        assert self.awesome.jumps_for_joy()
        
                context "with a string":
                    let "awesome": Awesome('wow!')
        
                    it "says it":
                        assert self.awesome.say() == "Awesome says 'wow!'"
