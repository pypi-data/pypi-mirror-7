Description: |travis-img| superss ====== *RSS parsing with batteries included*
        
        ``feedparser`` is great, but sometimes it doesn't put things in the same
        place. ``superss`` fixes this by finding all known candidates for urls,
        content, images, tags, dates, and authors and intelligently picking the
        best candidate. It also does some other cool things like author parsing
        with `lauteur <http://github.com/newslynx/lauteur>`__, url
        reconciliation with
        `siegfried <http://github.com/newslynx/siegfried>`__, and pulling links
        and images out of the article html.
        
        Another problem with RSS parsing is that feeds sometimes only include a
        summary of the article. ``superss`` can also extract the article's full
        text from the page itself with
        `particle <http://github.com/newslynx/particle>`__ and merging this data
        with the data from the RSS feed.
        
        Finally, some sites don't even have RSS feeds. In this case we combine
        `pageone <http://github.com/newslynx/pageone>`__ and
        `particle <http://github.com/newslynx/particle>`__ to create a feed of
        articles from article urls on a site's homepage.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
            pip install superss
        
        Test
        ----
        
        Requires ``nose``. (only currently tests full\_text rss feeds.)
        
        ::
        
            nosetests
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Grab full-text feeds:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from superss import SupeRSS
        
            s = SupeRSS('http://feeds.feedburner.com/publici_rss')
            for entry in s.run():
              print entry
        
        Grab non-full-text feeds. You must install
        `particle <http://github.com/newslynx/particle>`__ to run this.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from superss import SupeRSS
        
            s = SupeRSS('http://feeds.feedburner.com/publici_rss', is_full_text = False)
            for entry in s.run():
              print entry
        
        **Experimental**: Build a feed from a homepage. You must install
        `pageone <http://github.com/newslynx/pageone>`__ and
        `particle <http://github.com/newslynx/particle>`__ to run this.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from superss import SupeRSS
        
            s = SupeRSS(homepage = 'http://nytimes.com/')
            for entry in s.run():
              print entry
        
        Optionally pass in a list of urls to ignore. This option is for the
        purposes of depuplicating when we're polling a feed on an ongoing basis.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            s = SupeRSS('http://feeds.feedburner.com/publici_rss', ignore_urls=[])
            for entry in s.run():
              print entry
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        -  [ ] Add optional concurrency with ``gevent``
