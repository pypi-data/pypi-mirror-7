Description: |travis-img| superss ====== *RSS parsing with batteries included*
        
        ``feedparser`` is great, but sometimes it doesn't put things in the same
        place. ``superss`` fixes this by finding all known candidates for urls,
        content, images, tags, dates, and authors and intelligently picks the
        best candidate. It also does some other cool things like author parsing
        with `lauteur <http://github.com/newslynx/lauteur>`__, url
        reconciliation with `siegfried <http://github.com/newslynx/siegfried>`__
        and pulling links and images out of the article html.
        
        Another problem with RSS parsing is that feeds sometimes only include a
        summary of the article. ``superss`` can also extract the article's full
        text from the page itself using ``tk-name-of-article-extractor`` and
        then intelligently merging this data with the data from the feed.
