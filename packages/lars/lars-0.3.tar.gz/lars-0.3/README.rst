lars is a small `Python`_ framework for working with httpd logs (from a variety
of common servers like `Apache`_, `nginx`_, and IIS). The primary purpose is to
provide a set of conversions to ease loading such logs into relational
databases, but numerous other possiblities can be realized with a little
imagination.
