"""
This module contains classes centered around account, banks and transactions
between accounts.

The main class is an :class:`Account` holds a set of :class:`AccountTransaction`.

For accounts that are banks there's a :class:`BankAccount` class for
the bank specific state and for bill generation there's also
:class:`BillOption`.

Finally there's a :class:`AccountTransactionView` that is used by
the financial application to efficiently display a ledger.
