Description: Tim: Timed iteration monitor
        ============================
        
        A common pattern I have when writing code to import or treat large chunk of data is to do some printing to track the progress and some timing to monitor the speed.
        So I often end up with some variation of this in my code:
        
        ```python
        from datetime import datetime
        start = datetime.now()
        n = 0
        for i in my_iter:
            n+=1
            print "\r", i,
            # do stuff
        print start - datetime.now()
        print (start - datetime.now()) / n / 100
        ```
        
        
        which is a lot to remember and type which in turn make it easy to introduce bugs in some edge case which you need then to debug.
        
        So I wrote tim to help me do just that, so I have this pattern ready for use and working and can spend my time coding my data treatment instead of debbugging my helper code.
        
        *WARNING* : This is alpha level stuff, I'm still working out the proper way to do stuff so the API may still change a bit.
        
        How to use tim
        --------------
        
        Common usage pattern would probably be:
        
        ```python
        import tim
        
        tim.start()
        for i in my_iter:
            tim.pulse_print() # print current progress
            # do stuff
        tim.stop() # print overall stats and reset counter
        ```
        
        If you just need to monitor start and stop you can use:
        
        ```python
        tim.start()
        # calculation
        tim.stop() # print elapsed time and reset
        ```
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install tim
