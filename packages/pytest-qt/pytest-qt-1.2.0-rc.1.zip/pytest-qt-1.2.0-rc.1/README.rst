=========

pytest-qt is a `pytest`_ plugin to allow programmers write tests for `PySide`_ and `PyQt`_ applications.

The main usage is to use the `qtbot` fixture, responsible for handling `qApp` 
creation as needed and provides methods to simulate user interaction, 
like key presses and mouse clicks:


.. code-block:: python

    def test_hello(qtbot):
        widget = HelloWidget()
        qtbot.addWidget(widget)
    
        # click in the Greet button and make sure it updates the appropriate label
        qtbot.mouseClick(window.button_greet, QtCore.Qt.LeftButton)
    
        assert window.greet_label.text() == 'Hello!'

This allows you to test and make sure your view layer is behaving the way you expect after each code change.

Requirements
------------

Python 2.6 or later, including Python 3+.

Works with either PySide_ or
PyQt_ picking whichever is available on the system, giving
preference to ``PySide`` if both are installed (to force it to use ``PyQt``, set
the environment variable ``PYTEST_QT_FORCE_PYQT=true``).
