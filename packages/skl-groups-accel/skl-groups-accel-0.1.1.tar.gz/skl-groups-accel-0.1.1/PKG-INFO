Description: This package contains Cython extensions for the
        `skl-groups <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/skl-groups/>`_ package.
        Its purpose is to make skl-groups proper easier to install by not requiring
        a compiler or having FLANN installed / etc.
        
        It currently contains only a (much) faster implementation of the core portion
        of ``skl_groups.divergences.knn.KNNDivergenceEstimator``.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This code is written and tested for Python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4. 3.2 probably
        works. It is also only tested on OS X and Linux, though it's not known not to
        work on other platforms; let me know if you try it.
        
        The easy way to install is::
        
            $ conda install -c http://conda.binstar.org/dougal skl-groups
        
        if you use conda, which includes both skl-groups and skl-groups-accel.
        
        Otherwise, first install skl-groups and
        `cyflann <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/cyflann/>`_.
        You'll also need a compiler with OpenMP support,
        so gcc (not llvm-gcc) instead of clang
        (`for now <https://clang-omp.github.io/>`_).
        On OSX, do ``brew install gcc`` and then set ``CC=gcc-4.8``;
        Linux users probably have gcc installed,
        but make sure to set ``CC`` if you default to clang.
        Then you can::
        
            $ pip install skl-groups-accel
        
        or, from a source checkout,
        ``python setup.py install`` or ``pip install .`` or whatever.
        If you're installing from a source checkout you need a recent version of Cython.
