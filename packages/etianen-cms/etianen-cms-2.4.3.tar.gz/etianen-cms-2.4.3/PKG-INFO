Description: Etianen.com CMS
        ===============
        
        A Django-based Content Management System. It is extremely developer-friendly,
        and designed to be used as the basis for large, custom web applications.
        
        You'll need to be a Django developer to use this CMS, and there's no one-click
        installers. However, if you want something that'll stay out of your way while
        providing powerful content management facilities for your editors, you've come
        to the right place.
        
        **This is a preview release of an unfinished product. It's stable, secure and
        fast, but the API is still subject to change, and the documentation is pretty
        thin. Please [contact](mailto:dave@etianen.com) me if you have any questions.**
