#
# HamperDriver is a wrapper around the Selenium WebDriver class, adding HamperSingleton
# as a metaclass to provide singleton functionality to the WebDriver.
# 
# We wanted to have one browser window handle the whole process (certain tokens are passed to/from form submission
# which makes it a pain to have multiple browser windows handle the process)
#
