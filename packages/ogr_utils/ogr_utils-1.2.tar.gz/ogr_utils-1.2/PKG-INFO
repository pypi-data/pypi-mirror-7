        ===========
        
        ogr_utils is a small wrapper around the GDAL/ogr module. Basically it
        is an abstraction layer that adds some convience to reading, writing
        and manipulating geographic data formats.
        It provides three modules: geometry, research and copy_helper.
        
        **Important!** Obviously GDAL is required. As installation can be troublesome it is not including as a requirement in this distribution. Please install manually.
        
        Example one. Save a layer based on a query to a new shapefile::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from ogr_utils.copy_helper import CopyHelper
            c = CopyHelper()
            f = '/home/.../border_segs.shp'
            shp =ogr.Open(f,0)
            lyr = shp.GetLayer()
            lyr.GetFeatureCount()
            >>> 13411
            c.lyr_2_shp(lyr,f,'line')
            lyr_sel = shp.ExecuteSQL("select * from 'border_segs' where 'FID' < 100 ")
            lyr_sel.GetFeatureCount()
            >>> 100
            c.lyr_2_shp(lyr_sel,f,'line')
        
        Example two. Save a set of geo objects to a shapefile (or any other file format supported by ogr)::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from ogr_utils.geometry import Geometry
            g = Geometry( [(xy),], [(fieldname_1, type),(fieldname_2, type),], [(value_field_1,...),(value_field_2,...)] )
            f = '/home/.../outfile.shp'
            g.make_points(f)
        
        
        Example three. Get the geomtry of an evelope by it's lower left and upper right corner::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from ogr_utils.research import Research
            prof = Research()
            xy1 = (4.84692,52.3706) 
            xy2 = (4.84397,52.36611)
            bb = prof.get_bounding_box( [xy1,xy2] )
