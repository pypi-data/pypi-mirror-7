Python3 Blink(1) library
========================

About this library
------------------

This is a rewrite of ThingM's original Python library. It includes the following modifications:

* 100% test coverage on all library components
* Python 3.x compatible
* Automatic installation via Python Package Index.
* Higher level control over the blink(1).
* Single implementation with pyusb, intended to be installed with admin access or virtualenv.

Installation
------------

Use the pip utility to fetch the latest release of this package and any additional components required in a single step:

    pip install blink1

Developer installation
----------------------

Having checked out the blink(1) library, cd to python/pypi and run the setup script:

    python setup.py develop

Use
---

The simplest way to use this library is via a context manager.

    import time
    from blink1.blink1 import blink1

    with blink1() as b1:
        b1.fade_to_color(100, 'navy')
        time.sleep(10)

When the blink1() block exits the light is automatically switched off. It is also possible to access the exact same
set of functions without the context manager:

from blink1.blink1 import Blink1
    import time

    b1 = Blink1()
    b1.fade_to_rgb(1000, 64, 64, 64)
    time.sleep(3)
    b1.fade_to_rgb(1000, 255, 255, 255)

Unlike the context manager, this demo will leave the blink(1) at the end of execution.
