        What is ztfy.security ?
        =======================
        
        ztfy.security is a thin wrapper around zope.security and zope.securitypolicy packages.
        
        It provides an adapter to ISecurityManager interfaces, which allows you to get and set roles and
        permissions applied to a given principal on a given adapted context.
        
        This adapter also allows you to fire events when a role is granted or revoked to a given principal ; this
        functionality can be useful, for example, when you want to forbid removal of a 'contributor' role to a principal
        when he already owns a set of contents.
        
        Finally, ztfy.security provides a small set of schema fields, which can be used when you want to define a
        field as a principal id or as a list of principals ids.
