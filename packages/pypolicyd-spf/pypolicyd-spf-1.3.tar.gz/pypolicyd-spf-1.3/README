=================

This is python-policyd-spf, an external policy checker for the postfix mail
server.  It will use pyspf to check SPF records to determine if email should
be rejected by your server.

To install from the tar.gz (if this software has been packaged for your
distribution, the packaged version is recommended and should be installed
using your normal distribution packaging tools):

1.  Extract the package from the tarball (tar -xvvzf ...)
2.  Enter the package directory (cd ...)
3.  python setup.py build
4.  As root python setup.py install

It requires Python (python2.6, python2.7, or python3.2+), the pyspf
(python-spf) library version 2.0.7 or higher (2.0.9 is required for all
changes related to the RFC 7208 updates to the SPF design), and (for Python
versions before python3.3, the ipaddr module - for python3.3 and later the
built-in ipaddress module is used).  

If pyspf not available through your packaging system, it can be downloaded
 from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymilter/

If ipaddr not available through your packaging system, it can be downloaded
from:

http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/downloads/list

To use the optional RFC 7001 Authentication-Results header, the authres module
is also needed.  It is also need to run some tests.  It can be downloaded from
pypi or from:

https://launchpad.net/authentication-results-python

Nothing is configured by default, so this will not interact with Postfix until
it has been set up.

See man 1 policyd-spf for information on setting up and using this policy
server.

See man 5 policyd-spf.conf for configuration file information.
