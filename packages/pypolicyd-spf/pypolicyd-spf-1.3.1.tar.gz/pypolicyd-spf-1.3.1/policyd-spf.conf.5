.IX Title "policy-spf.conf 5"
.TH policy-spf.conf 5 "2012-03-17"
.SH "NAME"
python-policyd-spf \- pure-Python Postfix policy daemon for SPF checking
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
1\.3

.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
Usage:
  policyd-spf [/etc/policyd-spf/policyd-spf.conf]

.SH "OTHER DOCUMENTATION"
.IX Header "OTHER DOCUMENTATION"
This documentation assumes you have read Postfix's README_FILES/
SMTPD_POLICY_README and are generally familiar with Sender Policy Framework
(SPF).  See RFC 7208 for details.

man 1 policyd-spf provides general operation documentation for this
package.

man 5 policyd-spf.peruser provides documentation on setting up and using
different configuration options on a per user (mail reciepient) basis.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"

python-policyd-spf operates with a default installed configuration file and 
set of default configuration options that are used if the configuration file
cannot be found.  These options can be changed by changing the installed 
configuration files or through giving a path to an alternate configuration 
file.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"

Configuration options are described here and in the configuration file 
provided with the package.  The provided setup.py installs this configuration 
file in /etc/policyd-spf/.

Additionally, whitelisting certain IP addresses from SPF checks is supported.
This man page and the sample configuration file show the format to use.
These options can be adjusted on a per user (mail recipient) basis.  Details
on per user settings can be found in policyd-spf.peruser(5).

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"

.SH "LOGGING"
.IX Header "LOGGING"

"debugLevel" controls the amount of information logged by the policy server.

The default, 1, logs no debugging messages, just basic SPF results and errors
generated through the policy server.  This value can be increased up to 5 
(values higher than 5 will not cause an error, but will not log any additional
information).

debug level 2 adds a log message if no client address (IP address from which
the connection was made), Mail From addresss, or HELO/EHLO name is received by
the policy server, and logs SPF results for each Mail From and HELO check.

debug level 3 generates a log message each time the policy server starts and
each time it exits, as well as logging a copy of the exact header returned to
Postfix to be prepended into the message.  Each time the policy server starts,
debug level 3 also logs the configuration information used by the policy
server.

debug level 4 logs the complete data set received by Postfix via the policy
interface and when the end of the entry is read.

debug level 5 is used to debug config file processing and can only be set in 
code and not via the config file.

If debug level is 0, then the policy server logs errors only.

Default:

debugLevel = 1

.SH "TEST OPERATION"
.IX Header "TEST OPERATION"

The policy server can operate in a test only mode. This allows you to see the
potential impact of SPF checking in your mail logs without rejecting mail.
Headers are prepended in messages, but message delivery is not affected. This
mode is not enabled by default.  To enable it, set defaultSeedOnly = 0.

Default:

defaultSeedOnly = 1

.SH "HELO/EHLO CHECKING"
.IX Header "HELO/EHLO CHECKING"

HELO check rejection policy options are:

SPF_Not_Pass (default) - Reject if result not Pass, None, or Temperror
(alternatively put, reject if the SPF result is Fail, Softfail, Neutral,
PermError). Unlike Mail From checking, there are no standard e-mail use cases
where a HELO check should not Pass if there is an SPF record for the HELO name
(transparent forwarding, for example, is not an issue). HELO/EHLO is known
first in the SMTP dialogue and there is no practical reason to waste resources
on Mail From checks if the HELO check will already cause the message to be
rejected. This should not cause interoperability problems when used for HELO.

Softfail - Reject on HELO Softfail or Fail.  HELO/EHLO is known first in the
SMTP dialogue and there is no practical reason to waste resources on Mail
From checks if the HELO check will already cause the message to be rejected.
This should not cause interoperability problems when used for HELO.

Fail - Reject only on HELO Fail. HELO/EHLO is known first in the 
SMTP dialogue and there is no practical reason to waste resources on Mail 
From checks if the HELO check will already cause the message to be rejected. 
This should not cause interoperability problems when used for HELO. 

Null - Only reject HELO Fail for Null sender (SPF Classic).  This is the
approach used by the pre-RFC 4408 reference implementation and many of the pre-
RFC specifications.  Use of at least this option (SPF_Not_Pass or Fail) are
preferred) is highly recommended.

False - Never reject on HELO, append header only. This is useful for post-SMTP
spam filters such as SpamAssassin.

No_Check - Never check HELO.  This is only recommended if you are calling the
policy server twice (once for HELO checks and once for Mail From) with two 
different configuration files.  This approach is useful to get both the HELO
and Mail From headers prepended to a message.

Default:

HELO_reject = SPF_Not_Pass

.SH "HELO/EHLO PASS RESTRICTION"
.IX Header "HELO/EHLO PASS RESTRICTION"

HELO Pass Restriction allows integration with other Postfix access
controls by provding a user supplied name of a postfix access
restriction to be applied to a message when the HELO checking result
is Pass.  The indicated restriction must be an action as defined for a
Postfix SMTP server access table access(5) and explained in the
Postfix RESTRICTION CLASS README. The README.per_user_whitelisting file
provided with this distribution provides examples. Note: A helo pass
restriction will be the returned result even if the mail from result would
cause the message to be rejected.


Example:

HELO_pass_restriction = helo_passed_spf

Default:

None

.SH "Mail From CHECKING"
.IX Header "Mail From CHECKING"

Mail From rejection policy options are:

SPF_Not_Pass - Reject if result not Pass/None/Tempfail. This option
is not RFC 7208 compliant since the mail with an SPF Neutral result is treated
differently than mail with no SPF record and Softfail results are not supposed
to cause mail rejection.  Global use of this option is not recommended. Use
per-domain if needed (per-domain usage described below).

Softfail - Reject on Mail From Softfail or Fail.  Global use of this option is
not recommended. Use per-domain if needed (per-domain usage described below).

Fail (default) - Reject on Mail From Fail.

False - Never reject on Mail From, append header only.  This is useful for 
post-SMTP spam filters such as SpamAssassin.

No_Check - Never check Mail From/Return Path.  This is only recommended if you 
are calling the policy server twice (once for HELO checks and once for Mail 
From) with two different configuration files.  This approach is useful to get 
both the HELO and Mail From headers prepended to a message.  It could also be
used to do HELO checking only (because HELO checking has a lower false positive
risk than Mail From checking), but this approach may not be fully RFC 7208
compliant since the Mail From identity is mandatory if HELO checking does not
reach a definitive result.

Default:

Mail_From_reject = Fail

.SH "Mail From PASS RESTRICTION"
.IX Header "Mail From PASS RESTRICTION"

Mail From Pass Restriction allows integration with other Postfix access
contlols by provding a user supplied name of a postfix access
restriction to be applied to a message when the HELO checking result
is Pass.  The indicated restriction must be an action as defined for a
Postfix SMTP server access table access(5) and explained in the
Postfix RESTRICTION CLASS README. Note: A mail from pass restriction will
be the returned result even if the helo result would cause the message to be
rejected.

Example:

mail_from_pass_restriction = mfrom_passed_spf

Default:

None

.SH "Limit Rejections To Domains That Send No Mail"
.IX Header "Limit Rejections To Domains That Send No Mail"

No_Mail - Only reject when SPF indicates the host/domain sends no mail. This
option will only cause mail to be rejected if the HELO/Mail From record is
"v=spf1 \-all".  This option is useful for rejecting mail in situations where
the tolerance for rejecting wanted mail is very low. It operates on both HELO
and Mail From identities if set.

Default:

No_Mail = False

.SH "Domain Specific Receiver Policy"
.IX Header "Domain Specific Receiver Policy"

Using this option, a list of domains can be defined for special processing
when messages do not Pass SPF.  This can be useful for commonly spoofed
domains that are not yet publishing SPF records with \-all.  Specifically, if
mail from a domain in this list has a Neutral/Softfail result, it will be
rejected (as if it had a Fail result).  If needed, it is better to do it on a
per-domain basis rather than globally.

Example:

Reject_Not_Pass_Domains = aol.com,hotmail.com

Default:

None

.SH "Permanent Error Processing"
.IX Header "Permanent Error Processing"

Policy for rejecting due to SPF PermError options are:

True - Reject the message if the SPF result (for HELO or Mail From) is
PermError.  This has a higher short-term false positive risk, but does result
in senders getting feedback that they have a problem with their SPF record.

False - Treat PermError the same as no SPF record at all.  This is consistet
with the pre-RFC usage (the pre-RFC name for this error was "Unknown").

This is a global option that affects both HELO and Mail From scopes when
checks for that scope are enabled. The only per scope setting that can
over-ride this is Mail_From/HELO_reject = False/

Default:

PermError_reject = False

.SH "Temporary Error Processing"
.IX Header "Temporary Error Processing"

Policy for deferring messages due to SPF TempError options are:

True - Defer the message if the SPF result (for HELO or Mail From) is
TempError.  This is the traditional usage and has proven useful in reducing
acceptance of unwanted messages.  Sometimes spam senders do not retry.  
Sometimes by the time a message is retried the sending IP has made it onto a
DNS RBL and can then be rejected.  This is not the default because it is
possible for some DNS errors that are classified as "Temporary" per RFC 7208
to be permanent in the sense that they require operator intervention to
correct.

This is a global option that affects both HELO and Mail From scopes when
checks for that scope are enabled. The only per scope setting that can
over-ride this is Mail_From/HELO_reject = False/

False - Treat TempError the same as no SPF record at all.  This is the default
to minimize false positive risk.

Default:

TempError_Defer = False

.SH "Prospective SPF Check"
.IX Header "Prospective SPF Check"

Prospective SPF checking - Check to see if mail sent from the defined IP
address would pass.  This is useful for outbound MTAs to avoid sending mail that
would Fail SPF checks when received.  Disable HELO checking when using this
option.  It's only potentially useful for Mail From checking. SPF Received
headers are not added when this option is used.

Prospective = 192.168.0.4

Default:

None

.SH "LOCAL SPF BYPASS LIST"
.IX Header "LOCAL SPF BYPASS LIST"

Do not check SPF for localhost addresses - add to skip addresses to skip SPF 
for internal networks if desired. Defaults are standard IPv4 and IPv6 localhost
addresses. This can also be used, to allow mail from local clients submitting 
mail to an MTA also acting as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to be skipped.  An 
x-header is prepended indicating SPF checks were skipped due to a local
address.  This is a trace header only.  Note the lack of spaces in the list.

Default:

skip_addresses = 127.0.0.0/8,::ffff:127.0.0.0/104,::1

.SH "SPF IP WHITELIST"
.IX Header "SPF IP WHITELIST"

A comma separated CIDR Notation list of IP addresses to skip SPF checks for.
Use this list to whitelist trusted relays (such as a secondary MX and 
trusted forwarders).  An x-header is prepended indicating the IP was
whitelisted against SPF checks.  This is a trace header only.  Note the lack
of spaces in the list.

Example:

Whitelist = 192.168.0.0/31,192.168.1.0/30

Default:

None

.SH "SPF DOMAIN WHITELIST"
.IX Header "SPF DOMAIN WHITELIST"

Domain_Whitelist: List of domains whose sending IPs should be whitelisted from 
SPF checks.  Use this to list trusted forwarders by domain name.  Client IP
addresses are tested against SPF records published by the listed domains.  This
is useful for large forwarders with complex outbound infrastructures and SPF
records.  This option is less scalable than the SPF IP Whitelist.  An x-header 
is prepended indicating the IP was whitelisted against SPF checks.  This is a 
trace header only.  This option does nothing if the domain does not have an SPF
record.  In this case use the SPF IP Whitelist described above or
Domain_Whitelist_PTR (below). Note the lack of spaces in the list.

Example:

Domain_Whitelist = pobox.com,trustedforwarder.org

Default:

None

.SH "PTR DOMAIN WHITELIST"
.IX Header "PTR DOMAIN WHITELIST"

Domain_Whitelist_PTR: List of domains (and subdomains)  whose sending IPs
should be whitelisted from SPF checks based on PTR match of the domain. Use
this to list trusted forwarders by domain name if they do not publish SPF
records.  Client IP addresses PTR names are tested to see if they match the
listed domains.  This is useful for large forwarders with complex outbound
infrastructures, but no SPF records and predictable host naming. Matching is
done using the same rules as the SPF PTR mechanism as described in RFC 7208.
List the parent domain and all subdomains will match. This option is less
scalable than the SPF IP Whitelist.  An x-header is prepended indicating the IP
was whitelisted against SPF checks.  This is a trace header only.  This option
does nothing if the host does not have a PTR record record.  In this case use
the SPF IP Whitelist described above. Note the lack of spaces in the list.

Example:

Domain_Whitelist_PTR = yahoo.com,yahoogroups.com

Default:

None

.SH "RESULTS HEADER"
.IX Header "RESULTS HEADER"

The standard method for documenting SPF results in a message (for consumption
by downstream processes) is the Received-SPF header defined in RFC 7208. This
is the default header to use. Results can also be documented in the
Authentication-Results header, which is also covered in  RFC 7208. The default is
Received-SPF (SPF), but inclusion of Authentication-Results (AR) headers as an
alternative to Received-SPF can be specified. 

If there is a requirement to prepend both Received-SPF and Authentication-
Results headers, then it must be done by processing the message with more than
one instance of the policy server using different configuration files with
different Header_Type settings.

Examples:

Header_Type = SPF
or
Header_Type = AR

Default:

SPF

.SH "Authentications Results Authentication Identifier"
.IX Header "Authentications Results Authentication Identifier"

Every Authentication-Results header field has an authentication identifier
field ('Authserv_Id'). This is similar in syntax to a fully-qualified domain
name. See policyd-spf.conf.5 and RFC 7001 paragraph 2.4 for details.
Default is None.  Authserv-Id must be provided if Header_Type 'AR' is used.

The authentication identifier field provides a unique identifier that refers
to the authenticating service within a given administrative domain. The
identifier MUST be unique to that domain.  This identifier is intended to be
machine-readable and not necessarily meaningful to users.

Example:

Authserv_Id = mx.example.com

.SH "DNS Timeout Limit"
.IX Header "DNS Timeout Limit

RFC 7208 recommends an elapsed time limit for SPF checks of at least 20
seconds.  Lookup_Time allows the maximum time (seconds) to be adjusted.  20
seconds is the default.  

Example:

Lookup_Time = 20

Default

20 (seconds)

.SH "DNS Void Lookup Limit"
.IX Header "DNS Void Lookup Limit"
RFC 7208 adds a new processing limit called "void lookup limit" (See section
4.6.4).  Void lookups are DNS queries within an SPF record for which DNS
queries return either a positive answer (RCODE 0) with an answer count of 0,
or a "Name Error" (RCODE 3) answer.  This should not need to be changed.
Although new in an RFC in RFC 7208, this limit has been widely deployed in the
Mail::SPF perl library without issue.  Default is 2, but it can be adjusted.
Only relevant for pyspf 2.0.9 and later.  Ignored for earlier releases.

Example:

Void_Limit = 2

Default

2
