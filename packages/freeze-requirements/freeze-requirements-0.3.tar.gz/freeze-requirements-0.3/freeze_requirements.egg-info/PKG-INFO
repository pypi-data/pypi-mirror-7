        ===================
        
        A script to help creating and maintaining frozen requirements for pip.
        
        It is inspired by this `Mozilla dev team blog post <http://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2013/01/11/switching-to-pip-for-python-deployments/>`_, 
        who recently switched to pip for deployment.
        
        Basically it downloads packages from one or more pip 'normal' requirements
        files (the ones you use for development, containing only the 'top level'
        dependencies), and outputs the corresponding list of requirements to copy/paste
        in your frozen production requirements files.
        
        It can also upload the packages to your private pypi repository, and even
        download the packages from there to save bandwidth.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from pypi::
        
            $ sudo pip install freeze-requirements
        
        Or from source::
        
            $ sudo ./setup.py install
        
        If you want to use ``--upload`` you also need fabric::
        
            $ sudo pip install fabric
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Download packages locally::
        
            freeze-requirements requirements.txt --output /tmp/packages
        
        Process multiple requirements files at once::
        
            freeze-requirements requirements.txt requirements2.txt --output /tmp/packages
        
        Download packages and upload them to a remote host::
        
            freeze-requirements requirements.txt --upload user@private-pypi.example.com:/home/pypi/packages
        
        Same as above but download packages from the remote host. This may be faster as
        there is no need to upload the packages from your machine and the remote host
        may have a faster internet connection (pip needs to be installed on the remote
        host)::
        
            freeze-requirements requirements.txt --upload user@private-pypi.example.com:/home/pypi/packages --remote-pip
