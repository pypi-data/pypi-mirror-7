Description: Ckan API client
        ###############
        
        This package provides a client for the `ckan <http://ckan.org>`_ API.
        
        Specifically, it includes:
        
        - a **low-level client**, which is pretty much just a wrapper around
          HTTP calls, handling serialization and exception-raising.
        
        - a **high-level client**, attempting to make it easier / safer to perform
          certain operations on a ckan catalog.
        
        - a **synchronization client**, used to provide some automation
          for synchronization tasks of collections of datasets into a catalog
          (commonly referred to as "harvesting").
        
        
        Other than that, it attempts to get work around some common issues
        with that API, such as inconsistencies and bugs, trying to make
        sure problems are discovered earlier.
