"""
URL routing for Twisted Web resources.

A Python-based Domain Specific Language is used to specify and match routing
paths, string literal components are matched for structure while plain callable
components match segment values and are stored by name for use in the handler,
assuming all the components match; this makes it trivial to create new
functions to match path components.

`route` is used to match a URL exactly (the number of route components must
match the number of URL path segments) while `subroute` is used to match a URL
prefix (the specified route components must match the respective segments in
a URL path, additional segments are used in child resource location as normal.)

`Router` is an `IResource` that allows decorating methods as route or subroute
handlers.
