# TsTables

TsTables is a Python package to store time series data in HDF5 files using PyTables. It stores time
series data into daily partitions and provides functions to query for subsets of data across
partitions.

Its goals are to support a workflow where tons (gigabytes) of time series data are 
appended periodically to a HDF5 file, and need to be read many times (quickly) for analytical models
and research.

## Not ready for use yet

TsTables is not ready for use yet and is currently under development. The goal is to have something
workable and being testing by end of May, 2014. If you are interested in the project (to contribute
or learn when it is finished), email Andy Fiedler at <andy@andyfiedler.com>.
