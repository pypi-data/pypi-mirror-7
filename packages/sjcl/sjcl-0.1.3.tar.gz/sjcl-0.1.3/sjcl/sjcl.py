"""
Decrypt and encrypt messages compatible to the "Stanford Javascript Crypto
Library (SJCL)" message format.

This module was created while programming and testing the encrypted
blog platform on cryptedblog.com which is based on sjcl.

You need the pycrypto library with ccm support. As of 2014-05 you need a
special branch of pycrypto or a version >= 2.7a1.

See https://github.com/Legrandin/pycrypto .

You may use git to clone the ccm branch:
git clone -b ccm git://github.com/Legrandin/pycrypto.git .

#
#    ct: cipher-text your encrypted data, obviously
#    iv: Should be unique and not be reused with the same key for AES-CCM
#    salt: random, and is used to create the key from password with Pbkdf2
#    adata: additional authenticated data, is plain text data that you want
#        to include but ensure that it has not been tampered when using
#        AES-CCM. If you aren't ever going to include any data then you can
#        ignore it (you would have had to pass it with the plaintext in sjcl).
#
#    iter: iterations for Pbkdf2, this just needs to be high enough to slow
#        down bruteforce on your password needs to change with the speed of
#        hardware in the future.
#    ks: keysize to know what size key to generate with Pbkdf2, needs to change
#         with the amount of security in future
#    ts: tagsize to know what size authentication tag is part of your cipher
#         text
#    cipher: If you will only support AES, then you can just assume.
#    mode: if you will only support AES-CCM than you can just assume.
#    v: If you will only support one version of sjcl in the future than you can
#         just assume.
