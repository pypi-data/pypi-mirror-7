Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This Python package provides an interface to Parker Hannifin Gemini
        stepper/servo motor drives.
        
        .. note::
           
           Only the ASCII protocol is supported at this time, meaning that only
           newer GV6 and GT6 drives are supported.

               * Fixed bug in how ``GeminiG6.move_time`` calculated the time
                 a movement would take in the case that the drive cannot reach
                 its maximum velocity in the motion.
