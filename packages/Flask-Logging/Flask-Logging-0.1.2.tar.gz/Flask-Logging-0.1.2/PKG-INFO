Description: Flask-Logging
        -------------
        
        Filter certain requests from the Flask log. Useful during development
        when requests fill up with /static/ URLs. Not for use in production,
        Flask-Logging monkey patches the ``werkzeug`` logging function.
        
        Usage
        ^^^^^

            from flask.ext.logging import Filter
            filter = Filter('static')
        
        Filters any request with the word 'static' from the log.
        
        Filtering more than one word:
