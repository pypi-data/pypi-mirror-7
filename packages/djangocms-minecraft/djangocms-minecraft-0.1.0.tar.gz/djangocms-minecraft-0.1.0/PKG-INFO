Description: djangocms-minecraft
        ===================
        
        This is a simple set of plugins intended for use with Django-CMS, designed to aid in retrieving data from the servers.  
        Much of this code comes from Dinnerbone's amazing source (..thank you dude!) that he has graciously left as "fully open".
        
        See the plugins in action here_!

        Protocol documentation_ is available as well, thanks to Dinnerbone.

        IMPORTANT CHANGES from 0.0.1
        ----------------------------
        
        In 0.0.1 there was an issue with the plugin regarding socket timeout - this has been fixed in 0.1.0 - as well as quite a
        few other additions and changes.  However, these changes also resulted in requiring your plugins to be reconfigured in 
        edit mode after you have migrated the changes into your project from the update. Until you do this, they will be blank.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install with pip:
        
        ``pip install djangocms-minecraft``
            
        Or, optionally, install the development version:
            
        ``pip install git+https://git@bitbucket.org/oddotterco/djangocms-minecraft.git#egg=djangocms-minecraft``
        
        Then, in your project's settings.py file, add 'djangocms_minecraft' to the INSTALLED_APPS like so:
        
        ``INSTALLED_APPS += ('djangocms_minecraft',)``
            
        Finally, syncdb, migrate your project, and then simply add the plugins to pages as desired.  
        They will show up in both a text plugin's plugins list as well as the page plugins list, under the header "Minecraft".
