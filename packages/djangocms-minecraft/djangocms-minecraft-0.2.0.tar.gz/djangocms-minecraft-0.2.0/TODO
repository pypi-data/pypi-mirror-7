DOCS
~~~~

* Configuration tips, dos and dont's doc for new users (include info about security issues with enabling query) Use wiki?

CORE
~~~~

* Make the servers list reusable so that a user does not have to re-enter the server info - reduces error potential of
    bad data over multiple plugins pointing at the same server.
* Make server timeout configurable (use livesettings or store per-server?)
* Optional, configurable and RESTful JSON API for external consumers

QUERY-PLUGINS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Autocheck for dynmap plugin before offering to link the map in full_status plugin?
* Javascript option to auto-update the status on a page without refreshing
* Use the specific Minecraft server icon as the "server up" image if there is one

RCON-PLUGINS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add RCON support (whitelist, reload, etc)
* Help page plugin that populates using rcon
* Auto-check for supported plugins and offer RCON support as each becomes supported and available
* add entry-point for rcon command (mcrcon)
