        Notes
        =====
        following the best practice from this article:
        - http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/
        
        Language list for better .md rendering

        ### --clean
        Add `--clean` parameter to remove silp generated lines, usefel if want
          to change the language settings
        
        ### include other files in template
        The syntax is something like:
        ```
        <<[fish/fish.freshrc]
        ```
        This is following the Marked (a markdown preview app on OS X) rule, so Marked
        can show the included file content just fine.
        
        ### freshrc support
        freshshell is a very nice tool to manage dotfiles, though it doesn't support
        include other freshrc at the moment(2014-05-06), so I split my freshrc into
        smaller files, and use silp to put them into the main file.

        0.2.2
        -----
        - Bugfix with the .md files not included in Manifest
        
        0.2.1
        -----
        - Change name to "Simple Individual Line Preprocessor"
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        - Better control with the padding spaces to keep all `generated_surfix` aligned
        - Skipping files that not using SILP, to prevent the useless files in `.silp_backup`
          and `.silp_test` folders
        - Can support multiple project setting files with different extentions
        - If a subfolder has it's own setting files, won't include them in the parant's `--all` run
        
        0.1.0
