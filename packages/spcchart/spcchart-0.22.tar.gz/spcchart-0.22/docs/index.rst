==================================================
Control Charts for people who need them
==================================================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Controlchart is an :ref:`ISC Licensed <isc>` Control Chart library, written in Python, for normal people.

Control charts are really useful tools to help you understand how 'in control your process is'
so you can help make management changes based on real information.

Here's a quick demo:

Say I have a process that churns out widgets, and the quality (% of customers where the widget
has met or exceeded the customer's expectation)
is distributed as below:

    >>> widgets_quality = [56, 75, 82, 12, 34, 18, 22, 81, 88, 91, 76, 85, 100, 88, 43, 44]

Control charts are really easy to create - read the code - but reading a control chart, and doing
the right thing is more important than writing the code.

This is people's lives we're messing with :)

    >>> from spcchart import SpcChart
    >>> widgets_quality = [56, 75, 82, 12, 34, 18, 22, 81, 88, 91, 76, 85, 100, 88, 43, 44]
    >>> c = SpcChart(widgets_quality, title="Widget Quality")
    >>> c.render()


From the command line
----------------------

    >>> spcchart --data=56,75,82,12,34,18,22,81,88,91,76,85,100,88,43,44 --title="Widget Quality"
