Description: 
        This is the most recent long-period ephemeris published by the Jet
        Propulsion Laboratory.  While requiring more than half a gigabyte of
        space, it achieves quite high accuracy.

        This ephemeris incorporates ranging data from recent spacecraft
        missions, including the Cassini mission to Saturn, which results in an
        accuracy for Saturn of a few milliarcseconds for positions over the past
        decade.  If this ephemeris is too large for your application, take a
        look at `DE421 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de421>`_ and `DE423
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de423>`_ as alternatives.
        
        To compute using this ephemeris in Python, see the `jplephem
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jplephem>`_ package.
