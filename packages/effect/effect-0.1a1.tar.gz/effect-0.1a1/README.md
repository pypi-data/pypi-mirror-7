# Effect

Effect is a library for helping you write purely functional code by
isolating the effects (that is, state manipulation and IO) in your code.

You can [read the code](effect/__init__.py).


# Status

Right now Effect is in alpha, and is likely to change incompatibly.

- Twisted support may be factored out.
- The way effect implementations are specified is likely to change.

# Thanks

Thanks to Rackspace for allowing me to work on this project, and having an
*excellent* [open source employee contribution policy](https://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspaces-policy-on-contributing-to-open-source/).
