Description: Python FogBugz API Wrapper
        --------------------------
        
        This Python API is simply a wrapper around the FogBugz API, with some help from Leonard Richardson's BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and the magic of Python's __getattr__().
        
        Getting Started:
        ----------------
        To use the FogBugz API, install the package either by downloading the source and running
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        or by using pip
        
          $ pip install fogbugz
        
        A Quick Example:
        ----------------
        
        ::
        
          >>> from fogbugz import FogBugz
          >>> fb = FogBugz("http://example.fogbugz.com/") # URL is to your FogBugz install
          >>> fb.logon("logon@example.com", "password")
          >>> resp = fb.search(q="assignedto:tyler") # All calls take named parameters, per the API
          >>> resp # Responses are BeautifulSoup objects of the response XML.
          <response>
            <cases count="2">
              <case ixbug="1" operations="edit,assign,resolve,email,remind"></case>
              <case ixbug="2" operations="edit,spam,assign,resolve,reply,forward,remind"></case>
            </cases>
          </response>
          >>> # You shouldn't need to know too much about BeautifulSoup, but the documentation can be found here:
          >>> # http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html
          >>> for case in resp.cases.childGenerator(): # One way to access the cases
          ...     print case['ixbug']
          ...
          1
          2
          >>> for case in resp.findAll('case'): # Another way to access the cases
          ...     print case['operations']
          ...
          edit,assign,resolve,email,remind
          edit,spam,assign,resolve,reply,forward,remind
          >>> resp = fb.edit(ixbug=1, sEvent="Edit from the API") # Note the named parameters
          >>> resp
          <response><case ixbug="1" operations="edit,assign,resolve,email,remind"></case></response>
          >>> # To upload files, just pass a `Files` parameter that is a dictionary of filename and file handle. New in 0.9.2.
          >>> resp = fb.edit(ixbug=2, sEvent="Add a file from the API", Files={'filename': open('filename', 'r')}) # Note the named parameters
          >>> resp
          <response><case ixbug="2" operations="edit,assign,resolve,email,remind"></case></response>
        
        Note that, per API v5.0, all data between tags, such as the token, is now wrapped in CDATA.  BeautifulSoup's implementation of CData generally allows for it to be treated as a string, except for one important case: CData.__str__() (a.k.a. str(CData)) returns the full text, including the CDATA wrapper (e.g. "<![CDATA[foo]]>").  To avoid accidentally including the CDATA tage, use CData.encode('utf-8')
