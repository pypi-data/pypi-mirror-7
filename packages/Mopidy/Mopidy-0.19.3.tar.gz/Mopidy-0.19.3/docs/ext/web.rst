Here you can find a list of external packages that extend Mopidy with
additional web interfaces by implementing the :ref:`http-server-api`, which
was added in Mopidy 0.19, and optionally using the :ref:`http-api`.

This list is moderated and updated on a regular basis. If you want your package
to show up here, follow the :ref:`guide on creating extensions <extensiondev>`.
