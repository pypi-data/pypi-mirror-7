        This package provides the data type ``Month`` (typical usage:
        ``Month(4, 2003)``), which supports conversion to and from strings, as well as
        a zope.schema field and widgets for both zope.formlib and z3c.form.
        
        To use the month field, ``<include package="gocept.month"/>`` and declare a
        schema like this:
        
            >>> import gocept.month
            >>> import zope.interface
            >>> import zope.schema
            >>> class IContract(zope.interface.Interface):
            ...     title = zope.schema.TextLine(title=u"Contract title")
            ...     start = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Starting date")
            ...     end = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Ending date")
        
        To use the form widgets, you need to require the ``form`` setuptools extra
        (i.e. ``gocept.month[form]``), and ``<include
        package="gocept.month.browser"/>`` in your ZCML.
        
        
        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.3 (2014-07-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Add placeholder for month widget in z3c forms describing the required month
          format.
        
        
        1.2 (2013-02-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Split off widgets into setuptools extra ``form``, and don't include the
          ``browser`` ZCML by ourselves, so clients can use only the domain part of
          this package without the UI parts.
        
        - Added ``firstOfMonth`` method to ``Month``.
        
        - Using `zope.formlib >= 4.0` instead of `zope.app.form`.
        
        - Updated to ZTK 1.1.5.
