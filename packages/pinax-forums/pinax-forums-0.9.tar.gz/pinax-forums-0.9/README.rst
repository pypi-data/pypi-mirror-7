pinax-forums is a Pinax app for forums. It is focused on core forum
functionality and hence is expected to be combined with other Pinax apps
for broader features.

See `pinax-project-forums`_ for a full Django project incorporating numerous
apps with the goal of providing an out of the box forums solution.

pinax-forums was originally built by Eldarion and called `agora`. It incorporate
code and ideas from various client projects. The clients were kind enough to allow
Eldarion to open source the app and contribute it to Pinax.
