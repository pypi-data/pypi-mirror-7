<p>A question worth considering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to worship the creator God and discover thereby what it means to become fully and gloriously human, reflecting his powerful, healing, transformative love into the world? Or are you going to worship the world as it is, boosting your corruptible humanness by gaining power or pleasure from forces within the world but merely contributing thereby to your own dehumanization and the further corruption of the world itself?&#8221;</p>
<p>From N. T. Wright&#8217;s, <em>Surprised by Hope</em></p>

<p>If you spend five minutes scrolling through your Facebook feed, you are bound to come across at least one post that promises to help you determine whether you are right- or left-brain dominant. The lateralization theory explains your thinking and behavior based on which hemisphere calls the shots: the left (making individuals more rational, logical, precise, and having a strong preference for dogs) or the right (edging others toward being intuitive, subjective, and creative, which apparently translates to a general avoidance of printed directions and a predilection for cats).</p>
<p>However, according to Stephen Kosslyn and G. Wayne Miller, authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451645104/?tag=christtoday-20" target="_blank"><i>Top Brain, Bottom Brain</i></a>, this idea is little more than &#8220;a dominant pop-culture story&#8221; which has never &#8220;stood up to careful scientific scrutiny.&#8221; Recent work done by neuroscientists seems to indicate that both hemispheres of the brain work together in complicated processing tasks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/an-interview-with-novelist-margaret-ann-philbrick/screen-shot-2014-07-07-at-10-57-55-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-2751"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2751" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-07 at 10.57.55 AM" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-07-at-10.57.55-AM.png" width="312" height="467" /></a></p>
<p>Writer Margaret Ann Philbrick recently released her first novel, <em>A Minor</em>. Described as &#8220;a deeply moving novel that touches upon love, creativity, and memory, <em>A Minor</em> is a life-giving love story exploring the healing power of music for those suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia.&#8221; Philbrick shares on her process and what inspired the writing of this book.</p>
<p><strong><em>What inspired you to spend four years working on A Minor?</em></strong><br />My children all play the piano, and our oldest son’s teacher requested that a parent sit in on the lessons and take notes. We would then review with him during the following week. As he moved on to college, I was left with a notebook full of wisdom that needed to be shared, but I didn’t have the framework for an idea. While I was having lunch in South Haven, Michigan, I started talking to my husband about what it would be like for a concert pianist to lose his or her memory. That question took me on a one year research journey to find the answer.</p>
<p><strong><em>How did you go about your research?</em></strong><br />I started with Oliver Sacks because he is one of the most well-known neurologists in the field. I read his books and watched YouTube videos of him talking about his patients.  His work led me to many other experts and their writings. Once I completed that investigation, I embarked on several more months of research into the life of a concert pianist. Howard Reich’s biography of Van Cliburn was one of the most helpful. Also, I interviewed many people who had been touched by dementia and Alzheimer’s. Once I assessed all the research, I knew there was a story to mine out of that mountain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Talk about your creative process. How did you write the book?</strong></em><br />I’m a pretty insecure writer having been a Lit major and constantly reading books that I feel are beyond my own creative abilities. I actually think this is a good thing because I relied on the discipline of prayer before I sat down to write each day, knowing I couldn’t do this project alone. I’d spend time asking the Lord for creativity, original thought, wisdom, memory, whatever I needed to write the next ten pages. I’m disciplined when I get into a project, so I would write every day and then revise the next day what I wrote the day before and then move on. I always set goals for myself—another ten pages, finish the chapter. As I’d move along, another piece of research would be required, and I’d go off on a tangent for a day or so and then come back to the writing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you use the notebook from your son’s piano lessons?</strong></em><br />Oh, definitely. In many ways the voice of the main character is the voice of my son’s teacher. There are aspects of her in the work that I’m sure she’ll recognize when she reads it, like her clogs. She always wears these precarious, high-heeled wooden clogs. I’ve never known anyone to wear shoes like this in the summer with bare feet. She’s a fascinating conundrum.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your book has some unique features, like a Discussion Guide in the back and recorded music in the ereader that anyone can hear while they are reading and live links to other resources. How did all that happen?</strong></em><br />Well, I love Koehler Books because they are open to thinking outside the box of what a book can be. When I created A Minor, I thought about the music first. If you were only listening to the story, what would it sound like? Then I outlined all the musical works, and I’d listen to them while writing. It was important that the music told the story as well if not better than the words. Eventually, the idea came to me that I wanted the reader to have the same experience. Koehler Books was open to partnering with me in creating that experience. My husband was an enormous help as well. The Discussion Guide is for the classroom or book clubs. As a teacher, it comes naturally for me to ask questions so people can learn more. The live links send the reader to the places where they can get help with memory issues in their own family or even for themselves.</p>
<p><em><strong>One of your questions in the Discussion Guide addresses the importance of the protagonist maintaining the innocence of her protégé even though she could have taken advantage of him. Why did you decide to go that way and do you think American culture has lost its innocence?</strong> </em><br />Clare knows that the purity of Clive’s imagination is tantamount to his artistic interpretation of the works; it is a competitive advantage he has and a winsome one. She chose to not compromise that advantage. Yes, the loss of innocence in American culture is negatively affecting the power of our imagination and ultimately our innovation, which has always been an edge for us. When everything is openly revealed it hinders our ability to create, to make pictures for ourselves and interpret through the lens of what we know and experience. Dean Koontz has just written a novel that addresses this beautifully. It’s called Innocence. Making the choice to maintain one’s innocence and even more altruistically, the innocence of another, is expanding the pure heart of the child in all of us, and that is a great gift.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/travel-2/isocal-mar-0314-224-dgreco/" rel="attachment wp-att-2458"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2458" alt="iSoCal-Mar-0314-224-©DGreco" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/iSoCal-Mar-0314-224-©DGreco-1024x861.jpg" width="860" height="723" /></a>Since summer officially started a few weeks ago, I&#8217;ve already finished the first three titles. If you add your books to the comment section, you will be entered in a drawing to win ten of my original photo cards. If you subscribe to my site within the next ten days, you get two entries!</p>
<p>1. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Hope-Rethinking-Resurrection-Mission/dp/0061551821/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404413636&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=surprised+by+hope+n.t.+wright">Surprised by Hope</a>: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church</em>, N. T. Wright. This book has blown me away. It&#8217;s impossible to summarize it in a few sentences but this passage will give you the flavor of <em>Surprised</em>. &#8220;Jesus&#8217;s resurrection is the beginning of God&#8217;s new project not to snatch people away from earth to heaven but to colonize earth with the life of heaven. That, after all, is what the Lord&#8217;s Prayer is about.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/If-Only-Letting-Go-Regret/dp/0834132508/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404413672&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=if+only">If Only</a>: Letting Go of Regret</em>, Michelle Van Loon. If you are not familiar with Van Loon&#8217;s writing, I encourage you to follow her work on Her.meneutics. She&#8217;s smart, funny, pastoral, and doesn&#8217;t take herself too seriously. &#8220;If we have been called to follow Jesus out of the prison of our regrets, then he will use all things—including our poor choices and the painful ways in which the sins of others have affected our lives—for his redemptive purposes.&#8221; (Read my longer review <a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-letting-go-of-regret-with-michelle-van-loon/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>3. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Disaster-Finding-Midst-Brokenness/dp/1587433419/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404413706&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=a+Beautiful+disaster">A Beautiful Disaster</a>: Finding Hope and the Midst of Brokenness</em>, Marlena Graves. This is Graves&#8217;s first book and I already am eagerly anticipating her next. &#8220;Our God-bathed wilderness experiences have two results: the opening of our eyes and the unclogging of the pores of our souls.&#8221; (Read my longer review <a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-a-beautiful-disaster-and-the-role-of-community/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>4. <em><a href="https://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=4114">Slow Church</a>: Cultivating Community in the Patient Way of Jesus</em>, C. Christopher Smith and John Pattison. I am half-way through this offering and they definitely have me hooked. Smith and Pattison are thoughtful and willing to topple many a sacred cow. &#8220;To imagine a slow church is to trust that God has reconciled all things in Christ, to resist worship of the nation, and to embody our call to be peacemakers, bearing witness to God&#8217;s reconciliation in Christ beginning in our own particular places.&#8221;</p>
<p>5. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Feast-Chronicle-Farm---Table/dp/0393088898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404413751&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=growing+a+feast+the+chronicle+of+a+farm-to-table+meal">Growing a Feast</a>: the Chronicle of a Farm to Table Meal</em>, Kurt Timmermeister. The author, a farmer/chef/cheese maker on Vashon Island (off the coast of Seattle) describes all of the behind the scenes work that went into preparing a feast for twenty friends. Consider it a book version of the movie, Babette&#8217;s Feast.</p>
<p>6.<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Joy-No-Fun-Parenthood/dp/0062072226/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404413811&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=all+joy+and+no+fun"> All Joy and No Fun</a>: The Paradox of Modern Parenting</em>, Jennifer Senior. I disagree with the author&#8217;s title but since I am always curious about what others are offering for those of us who are parents, I grabbed this from the library. From the book cover, &#8220;Senior deconstructs the kinds of experiences that all parents have but few parents talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Invention-Wings-Sue-Monk-Kidd/dp/0670024783/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404413859&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+invention+of+wings"><em>The Invention of Wings</em></a>, Sue Monk Kid. &#8220;This fictionalized account of the pioneering abolitionist Sarah Grimke and the slave girl she received on her 11th birthday is an important addition to this year&#8217;s spate of works examining the immense and lasting evil wrought by slavery.&#8221; (From Karen Swallow Prior on the <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2014/july/great-big-hermeneutics-summer-reading-list.html?paging=off">Her.meneutics&#8217;</a> summer reading list. Also worth checking out.)</p>
<p>8. <em><a href="https://wipfandstock.com/store/Blessed_and_Beautiful_Multiethnic_Churches_and_the_Preaching_that_Sustains_Them">Blessed and Beautiful</a>: Multiethnic Churches and the Preaching that Sustains Them</em>, Lisa Washington Lamb. From the publisher&#8217;s website, &#8220;Why does the church in the United States still find it so difficult to integrate across racial and ethnic divides? In <i>Blessed and Beautiful</i> Lisa Lamb trains her sights on one often overlooked facet of forging life together: the magnetic power of shared memories&#8230;. While keenly aware of the complex dynamics involved, Lamb ultimately gives pastors and other church leaders a glimmer of hope as they seek to build reconciled communities of faith.</p>
<p>9. <a href="https://wipfandstock.com/store/Women_Leadership_and_the_Bible_How_Do_I_Know_What_to_Believe_A_Practical_Guide_to_Biblical_Interpretation">Women, Leadership, and the Bible</a>, Natalie Wilson Eastman. Also from the Wipf &amp; Stock website, &#8220;What do you believe about women&#8217;s roles in church leadership? Should women lead groups that include men? Should women preach? Should women be ordained? More importantly, why do you believe what you believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>10. <em><a href="http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=4312">Teach Us to Want</a>: Longing, Ambition &amp; the Life of Faith</em>, Jen Pollock Michel. &#8220;We often feel the urge to hide our longings, especially in the church. Through her own story of fear, loss and God&#8217;s goodness, Jen Michel stirs us to recover and reshape these desires in light of the kingdom of God,&#8221; by Rebekah Lyons.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/fearfully-and-wonderfully-made-or-shamefully-and-mistakenly-made-how-the-first-moon-ad-gets-menstruation-very-wrong/firstmoon-jul-0714-004-dgreco/" rel="attachment wp-att-2711"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2711" alt="firstmoon-Jul-0714-004-©DGreco" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/firstmoon-Jul-0714-004-©DGreco-1024x775.jpg" width="516" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>Back in 1973, when I was 13, I opened the door to my bedroom to find a small, flower-covered box discreetly labeled with an unfamiliar word—KOTEX. Curious, I quickly opened it to discover several mysterious objects and a mini-pamphlet complete with frightening diagrams and instructions for how to use the enclosed products. There was no follow up conversation with mom. No explanation for how—or why—this box magically appeared on my dresser. And mine was not an isolated experience.</p>
<p>Forty years later, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEcZmT0fiNM">First Moon ad</a> appears on television and the internet, advertising the same products, but with slightly edgier marketing. In case you missed it, a young teen fakes her period and lies to her mom. Her infuriated mother attempts to get even by hosting an impromptu First Moon party complete with bobbing for ovaries (made one hundred times worse by the fact that it&#8217;s her grandfather who emerges from underwater with an ovary in his mouth), pin the pad on the period, talk of a vagina cake, and a uterus piñata. We’ve come a long way baby. Or have we?</p>
<p>Despite the fact that American culture has been mostly mute on this topic, to this day, various tribes and people groups bestow honor and blessings upon girls as they experience their first menses. The flow of blood symbolizes her transition to womanhood and all of the possibilities—and trials—that come along with this rite of passage. According to <a href="http://www.drnorthrup.com/womenshealth/healthcenter/topic_details.php?topic_id=109">Dr. Christine Northrup</a>,</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Navaho people still practice their puberty ritual for girls, the kinaalda. This is considered to be the most important of all their rituals because it brings new life to the tribe. In the month after a girl gets her first period, her entire extended family gathers together for a ceremony that takes place over four days. During this time the girl wears a traditional buckskin dress and her hair is braided in a special way. Each morning she gets up at sunrise and runs toward the rising sun. She is expected to run farther and faster each day. When she returns, an older female relative, taking the role of Ideal Woman, teaches her the Beauty Way, massages her body, and also instructs her in tribal wisdom about male-female relationships. Throughout the ceremony, the girl is expected to take on a new level of responsibility for herself and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our individualistic—and misogynistic—culture’s response to this key event pales in comparison. This week, I posted a survey on FaceBook titled <em>Coming of Age in America</em>. Only seven percent of the respondents were celebrated by one or both of their parents. A similar percentage received comprehensive information from an emotionally connected parent or relative. For most of us, the experience was a detached, clinical transfer of facts that left us confused, ashamed, frightened, grossed out, and/or embarrassed.</p>
<p>The meta message we all got was that having our period made us less than and therefore, needed to be concealed from others. This opposes God&#8217;s heart for us as women. One respondent summed it up when she wrote, “This kind of thing was simply not discussed in our house.” Because most of us lacked ongoing dialogue, we furtively asked questions in hushed voices at sleepovers or while we disrobed in the locker room. We gleaned whatever information we could from poorly done movies or awkward health class teachers.</p>
<p>And we often got it wrong. I remember my best friend calling me in tears—as a high school junior—when she realized that babies grew not in the stomach but in a mysterious organ called a uterus. One survey respondent admitted that because she feared using a tampon, she placed a sanitary napkin on her bathing suit and proceeded to go to swim practice. When she emerged from the pool, she was mortified at the bulging, dripping mass between her legs. Another thought the adhesive pads were to be used like a band-aid and stuck it to her genitals. Just imagine what that felt like to remove!</p>
<p>Young girls approaching this milestone need much more than a transfer of information. They need support, they need respect, and they need to understand how wonderful their bodies actually are. One woman wrote, “I think the biggest thing I hope to communicate to my daughter regarding her body is how miraculously we were created; the fact that we can create life, bring it forth into this world, and then sustain it for months and months is nothing short of a super power. I never want our capacity for that to be shortchanged.”</p>
<p>The First Moon ad certainly falls short of this goal. It takes what should be treated with great care and reduces it to a mockery. The disrespectful teen and spiteful mother (as well as clueless males) degrade and cheapen us as women. What the ad succeeds in doing—beside bringing this issue out of hiding—is to reveal the failure of our culture, including our churches, to navigate this topic in a dignified fashion.</p>
<p>The ad serves as a wake-up call for us as adults to accurately communicate what’s going on in a young girl’s body but to also help them recognize how amazing their bodies actually are. Years ago, one of our friends recounted his daughter’s coming of age story. She threw open the front door, dropped her books, and asked her father, “Where’s mom?” He knew something was troubling her so he asked, “What’s wrong?” She replied, “I got my period.” With that, he flung his arms around her and said, “Honey, go get changed. I’m taking you out to celebrate. You are a woman now and I want you to know how special you are to me.” When our friend told this story, I burst into tears. How I longed to have such a father! Many years later, I know that my heavenly Father felt that love, pride, and joy when I got my first period. Let’s figure out—as a culture and as a church—how we can celebrate our daughters&#8217; first menses with dignity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-letting-go-of-regret-with-michelle-van-loon/screen-shot-2014-06-27-at-11-58-14-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-2704"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2704" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-27 at 11.58.14 AM" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-27-at-11.58.14-AM.png" width="211" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>2013 was a year filled with regret. My husband and I had to make some incredibly painful choices about moving on from a community that we loved. Night after night, we tortured ourselves by revisiting decisions we had made, conversations that had gone awry, and cues that we apparently missed. After months of this addictive, futile behavior, we sobered up and resolutely decided to let go. To free fall. There was no next job lined up and no suggested six months of savings. The college tuition, mortgage, food, oil, and medical bills did not magically stop—a reality which sometimes looped us back into our little regret binges.</p>
<p>“Regret was never meant to be a destination,” writes <a href="http://michellevanloon.com/">Michelle Van Loon</a> in her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/If-Only-Letting-Go-Regret/dp/0834132508/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392652000&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=if+only+letting+go+of+regret">If Only: Letting Go of Regret</a>. But for most of us, it’s not only a destination but a way of life.</p>
<p>We regret eating that piece of pie. We regret hitting send before we toned down the sarcasm. We regret buying that extra pair of shoes, not asking for a raise, not spending more time with an aging parent.</p>
<p>The key words connected to regret are, <em>I wish</em>. Regret leaves us wishing we had made different choices and longing for a redo. It hoodwinks us into believing that if we work something long enough, we will be able to create an alternate universe where everything comes out perfect (a la Bill Murray in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSVeDx9fk60">Groundhog Day</a>). Meanwhile, as the sun continues to rise and set on the rest of humanity, we remain immobilized—or perhaps more accurately, moving only in reverse.</p>
<p>We all know that rewriting the script only happens in Hollywood. We can’t have a redo. However, we don’t have to remain mired in regret. If instead of hitting the rewind button, we push pause and initiate a conversation with God, regret, much like anger, can help us grow. The apostle <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20corinthians%207:10&amp;version=NLT">Paul</a> wrote, “For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation&#8230;. But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death.” Replace the word <em>sorrow</em> with <em>regret</em>, and we gain a deeper understanding of the redemptive purpose regret can have in our lives.</p>
<p>In order to glean the gift embedded in regret, we need to recognize how eddying around and around makes us so dizzy that we lose our ability to grab hold of God’s mercy and grace. The enemy of our soul would love to suck us forever down in a whirlpool of regret and shame. We stop the centrifugal force when we give ourselves permission to grieve our losses and bring our sin and shame to the One who has the power to forgive and release us.</p>
<p>Unprocessed regret can often causes us to make reactive decisions. According to Van Loon, “Regret creates false boundaries out of the <em>woulda, coulda, shouldas</em> that exist in our lives. For instance, I may regret not finishing college–and that regret may translate into not only the logical consequence for that action (“I will never be a brain surgeon.”) but the false boundary, or lie, that might mean settling for a career I hate and for which I am not suited.”</p>
<p>“Regret is a thief.” And indeed, as my husband and I hyper-processed our situation, an entire year slipped past. We eventually made the unilateral decision to stop entertaining the woulda, coulda, shouldas and, having done all that we knew to do, simply wait–in faith–for God to redeem our mistakes and our losses. Van Loon hopefully concludes, &#8220;If we have been called to follow Jesus out of the prison of our regrets, then he will use all things—including our poor choices and the painful ways in which the sins of others have affected our lives—for his redemptive purposes.”</p>

<p>This is what can happen when you take your eyes off the road for approximately two seconds. Our son, normally a great driver, was trying to figure out if the GPS was sending him in the correct direction. Two seconds. Tops. He was traveling 20-25 MPH.</p>
<p>Thankfully, other than an abrasion on his arm, he was unhurt.</p>
<p>For his two second attention lapse, the price tag will run:<br />Insurance deductible $500<br />Loss of his good driver status, insurance increase $250 for six years $1500<br />To replace the vehicle with another van (this one was totally paid for and running great) $12-28K</p>
<p>That’s about $10,000 per second.</p>
<p>And it could have been worse. <a href="http://www.ktvb.com/on-tv/sevens-hero/Woman-injured-in-crash-speaks-out-against-texting-while-driving-232291711.html">Ashley Zumbrunnen</a> pulled out her phone on the way to work to text her husband, “I love you. Have a good day.” She lost control of her car, flipped, and as a result, is now paralyzed from the neck down. <a href="http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/19897049/police-teen-killed-in-crash-on-first-day-of-school-was-texting">Deianerah Logan</a> was texting on her way to her first—and last—day as a high school senior when she crashed into the back of a school bus. Logan died that afternoon. I could go on.</p>
<p>According to the National Safety Council, twenty-eight percent of all accidents are related to cell phone use and texting. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Multitasking while driving doesn’t work!</em></strong></span><br />So please&#8230;<br />Ignore the text message notification. <br />Ignore the ringing phone. Whoever is calling you can wait. <br />Stop taking photos when you are driving. <br />Pull over if you need to program your GPS. <br />Parents, model this for your teen drivers. Soberly communicate to them the necessity of keeping their devices out of reach when they are at the wheel. <br />Stay alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-a-beautiful-disaster-and-the-role-of-community/screen-shot-2014-06-13-at-12-12-57-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-2652"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2652" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-13 at 12.12.57 PM" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-13-at-12.12.57-PM.png" width="203" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>Few of us choose to spend time in the wilderness. It’s disorienting, lonely, and at times, crushing. The Father’s voice, normally clear and audible, becomes static—as if we’ve moved beyond the range of his radio frequency. The desert unequivocally transforms us. What that transformation looks like has everything to do with our willingness to humbly wrestle with three questions; Who am I?; Is God good?; and Will I choose the way of the cross?</p>
<p>Marlena Graves has made many sojourns into the desert. She writes, “I lived in a world of turmoil. Many days, I felt as if my heart had been violently ripped out, thrown to the ground, and left for scavengers&#8230;. I needed [God] (and still need him) to show me how to live.”<br /><em><br /></em>The truth is, we all do but because most of us live in abundance, we don’t know it. Graves didn’t have the option of avoiding the desert which turns out to be a blessing for anyone who reads her new book, <em>A Beautiful Disaster</em>. After much suffering and many rounds in the ring with God, she has emerged as a prophet, sage, and guide for the rest of us. I interviewed Graves on the three essential questions for an article that will appear in Her.meneutics next week. Today, I want to drill down into Graves’s insight on the role of community while we are in the desert.</p>
<p>She titles chapter four <em>Loved into Resurrection</em>. Stop for a moment and ponder that concept. Have you ever been in a terribly difficult place and had men and women circle around you and extend God’s limitless love? It’s a game changer, isn’t it? One of our deepest desires—and most intense struggles—is to believe that we are lovable, particularly when we are angry, sick, or otherwise unattractive.</p>
<p>As I witness tragedies, early deaths from cancer, unexpected divorces, and the like, one thing that becomes obvious to me is that we tend to either reach out and ask for help or disappear and attempt to go it alone. I write <em>attempt</em> because it rarely works out well, especially when we are in need.</p>
<p>Marlena recounts the story of the paralytic in Mark 2 as an example of our profound neediness for others. She writes:<br /><em>&#8220;This man could do little for himself. He was completely dependent upon others to feed him, clothe him, bathe him, and take him to the bathroom&#8230;. One day, his friends had the idea of taking him to Jesus. And so this man found himself in the center of his friends as they carried him to Jesus, an action that offers a picture of true intimate community&#8230; There are times in our lives when we’re exhausted, lonely, and weary. Life afflicts us. Our faith falters. We are overwhelmed—paralyzed by discouragement and left alone in our own wilderness. We don’t have the physical or emotional wherewithal to go to Jesus. During these times, we are the paralytic. We can do little if anything for ourselves. What are we to do then? We call on trusted others within Christ’s community. We humble ourselves by confiding in them. We allow ourselves to be loved. We learn to let God care for us by allowing others to care for us. We learn to receive our daily bread from others.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In case you have not had the experience of lying on a mat and being carried around, it’s terribly humiliating and vulnerable. In those seasons when I have had to face my limitations and depend upon others, I can almost see my flesh dying. I desperately want to believe the lie that I don&#8217;t need anyone—that God is enough. And if “function” is the measure of success, that works. But I think Jesus wants us to live not as withered, emotionally crippled men and women but as vibrant individuals who thrive and love. How else will we reflect his glory to those around us? How else will we usher his kingdom to the earth?</p>
<p>Graves quotes Jean Vanier, one of the founder of L’Arche communities:<br /><em>&#8220;My experience has shown that when we welcome people from this world of anguish, brokenness, and depression, and when they gradually discover that they are wanted and loved as they are and that they have a place, then we witness a real transformation—I would even say ‘resurrection.’&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Graves concludes, <em>“How beautiful. In Christ’s power and through his presence, we can love others and be loved into resurrection.”</em> This idea of loving each other into resurrection is indeed beautiful and glorious and painful and difficult. When it happens, you will be forever changed.</p>
<p><em>A Beautiful Disaster</em> will become a classic, read for decades. Graves is wise, warm, and oh so generous in sharing what she has learned during her walks down the wilderness roads.<em></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-let-us-refuse-to-take-graduation-for-granted/g2grad14-jun-0614-094-dgreco-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-2631"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2631" alt="G2Grad14-Jun-0614-094-©DGreco-3" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/G2Grad14-Jun-0614-094-©DGreco-3-1024x682.jpg" width="516" height="343" /></a></p>
<p>Watching my son’s graduation ceremony this week, I wondered, <em>Why is this such a big deal? Why do we celebrate this so religiously</em>?</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/high-school-graduation-rate-could-hit-90-percent-106085.html">studies</a> published earlier this year, headlines lauded eighty percent of US students graduated from high school in 2012, the highest percentage since they’ve been keeping track. I immediately wondered, <em>What about that 20%</em>?</p>
<p>And what about disabled American students who, according to an article in <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/high-school-notes/2014/04/28/high-school-graduation-rates-reach-record"><em>USNews,</em></a> graduate “at a rate of about 20 percent less than the national average&#8230;. In Nevada, the graduation rate for students with disabilities is 24 percent.” For Hispanic and African American students, the graduation rate also dips 10 to 15 percent below the national average.</p>
<p>In developing countries around the world, the number are far more depressing. Liberia graduates 65%—from primary school. Mozambique’s stats are worse: 52%. In many of these countries, mandatory fees for uniforms, books, and supplies put education out of reach. In the Dominican Republic, where unemployment hovers around 40%, the average family makes less than $500 per month. With school fees ranging from $75-100 per child, only 52% complete high school and this figure drops precipitously in rural areas where most schooling stops after 5th grade.</p>
<p>For girls in many countries, fighting for an education is a matter of life and death, as <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/high-school-notes/2014/04/28/high-school-graduation-rates-reach-record">Malala</a> so courageously demonstrated.</p>
<p>Most of you reading this article not only graduated from college but have advanced degrees. Our privilege affords us opportunities and a lifestyle that many around the world continue to envy. I am by no means attempting to make anyone feel guilty for that privilege, but I do hope to encourage all of you to leverage it by stretching to help others receive what we so often take for granted. So yes, let’s celebrate the accomplishments of our high school graduates and let us not forget those in our country and across the globe who can only dream about receiving their diplomas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-how-photography-exposes-our-self-hatred/20th-october10090041/" rel="attachment wp-att-2596"><img class="wp-image-2596 alignnone" title="On my 50th birthday in flattering, low light." alt="20th-October10090041" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20th-October10090041-678x1024.jpg" width="326" height="491" /></a><em>  On my 50th birthday in flattering, low light.</em></p>
<p>Many years ago, I photographed a well-known author/professor/psychiatrist. As he was finishing up a phone conversation, I set up my lights and moved a trash can from view. When he put down the receiver, he roared, “Who gave you permission to touch my things?” I stopped and stood frozen in his palatial office uncertain if he was actually asking a question or simply scolding me. Since I typically default to the low road in such circumstances, I offered an apology and went on to add, “I am sorry if this is a bad time for me to be here. I am well aware that when someone is making a photograph, they are forcing you to be vulnerable and if that’s not your choice, it can make you feel very uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>His shoulders softened and he responded—in total seriousness—“I thought I was the psychiatrist here.” I laughed and thankfully, we actually had a good session. I left with a singed copy of his most recent book, a warm handshake, and a grateful heart; it doesn’t always end so well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-how-photography-exposes-our-self-hatred/139-portraitsimg_0259/" rel="attachment wp-att-2598"><img class="wp-image-2598 alignnone" alt="139-portraitsimg_0259" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dlcg-Jun-0610-002-©DGreco-682x1024.jpg" width="327" height="491" /></a><em>  Me with a double chin, but happy.</em></p>
<p>During the past two weeks, I’ve been making thousands of images of folks who are richer and more powerful (in worldly metrics) than me. They drive Mercedes Benz, BMWs, and Range Rovers. (Our entire house could fit into their garages.) They command respect and attention when they walk into a social setting. Yet none of their power, prestige, or wealth are able to subdue the self hatred which rises to the surface when I point my lens in their direction.</p>
<p>“Can you Photoshop my eyes to make them larger?”<br />“Will you trim some weight off my neck and upper arms?”<br />“Can you take ten years off my face?”<br />“I always look horrible in photographs.”<span id="more-2595"></span></p>
<p>These are actual questions that I have been asked and feelings that have been confessed to me. In each situation, I feel a combination of deep sadness and anger. I want to ask, “Who told you you look terrible? Who told you your eyes were not beautiful or that you needed to be ten years younger?” Of course, I am asking a rhetorical question because I know the answer. I have been getting feistier as I age and on one occasion this week said, “I’m not sure who told you that you don’t photograph well but whoever it was lied.”</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>  How I wish I always looked.</em></p>
<p>We seldom go through our days aware that we do in fact have an enemy who delights in tearing us down, in lying to us, in trying to separate us from ourselves, from God, and from each other. But we do. And in those moments when the power brokers cringe before my lens, perhaps fearing that I and others will see what they work so hard to conceal, the enemy is manifest.</p>
<p>Our perception of beauty is complicated. The media portrays the ever under thirty, ever anorexic, white woman as the standard to which we should all aspire. According to an article in the New York Times, the average model is 5’9” and weighs 118 pounds. The average American woman is 5’2” and 140 pounds. That seven inch, twenty-eight pound differential can crush those of us who will never replicate these standards. And so we dodge the cameras, hide behind others, or frantically seek out professional sculptors who inject us with toxins or surgically remove unwanted fat. I have no moral objections for Botox or plastic surgery but when we seek external remedies to an internal sickness, we won’t be cured.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.dorothygreco.com/friday-soul-food-how-photography-exposes-our-self-hatred/ifam-sep-0912-018-dgreco/" rel="attachment wp-att-2601"><img class="wp-image-2601" alt="ifam-Sep-0912-018-©DGreco" src="http://www.dorothygreco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ifam-Sep-0912-018-©DGreco-768x1024.jpg" width="369" height="491" /></a><em>  How I normally look.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Few of us would admit to having pockets of self-hatred. It feels shameful and immature. Stating that we struggle to accept ourselves, all of ourselves—even those parts which are troubling and under construction—is mandatory if we want to find freedom. In my journey with self-hatred, I have found that simply talking about it isn’t enough. I need to actually call it sin and deal with it as such.</p>
<p>Labeling self-hatred as a sin might seem counter-intuitive. The logic behind this is that we are all created in God’s image. God himself stated that his creation was good. That means God sees me, a fifty-three year old woman carrying an extra twenty pounds, with my angular nose and smallish eyes, as good. Any pejorative labels we stick on ourselves simply discount this reality.</p>
<p>As people who follow Jesus, we hopefully know what to do with sin: confess it (as in out loud to another human being) and repent. Over the years, I’ve found confession increasingly easy. It’s the repentance part which takes concerted effort and determination. I have trained myself to listen to my self talk. When I was younger and made mistakes, I would often say, “What a jerk. I can’t believe I was so stupid.” Or I’d glance at myself as I passed by a mirror and categorize everything that I deemed unacceptable about my body. I now know and recognize such thoughts as the enemy’s. I will not submit to them. I want to live out the rest of my days being able to accept who I am and what I look like <em>even as I endeavor to be transformed into Christ’s image</em>. So when those pesky thoughts pop up or when I notice that I’m avoiding mirrors, I actually say—out loud and with as much authority as I can muster—“I rebuke you spirit of self-hatred. Leave me alone and go to the foot of the cross.” If Scripture is to be believed, our enemy is not “flesh and blood but evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world.” (Ephesians 6:12) If you have committed your life to Christ, the authority we have is greater than the enemy’s authority and he has to obey us. And rest assured, as you are reading this, he wants you to think I’m a lunatic.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As a challenge, ask a friend to make some photos of you. Look directly into the camera. Spend sometime with the images and purge the negative thoughts that surface. God does not want us to hide and He does not want us to condemn ourselves.</p>
<p>One of the shoots last week wasn’t going well. My subject was balled up with anxiety and no amount of affirming words could help her relax. Though I knew this was risky, I said, “This is not my normal protocol but I’d like to pray for you and for this time. Would that be okay?” She seemed skeptical but agreed. I invited God’s presence into the room, into her mind, and told any accusing spirits to leave. The shoot went well from then on. (Whether or not this gets back to my editors and I ever get asked to do another assignment remains to be seen!) We are living in a war zone; don’t assume you have to make friend with the enemy. Next time you find yourself on the other end of a camera lens, think of all of the unique ways that you reflect the image of God. Remember that you are fearfully and wonderfully made. And then smile—really smile—because you are beautiful and you are loved. Wrinkles, double chin, extra weight and all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(This was the moment when we realized we were only halfway through our eight mile hike. The expressions have not been Photoshopped.)</p>
<p>Several years ago while hiking with our kids in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, Rocky Mountain National Park, we realized that our beloved boys were doing a great impression of ungrateful, whiny brats. This perplexed and frustrated us until my husband and I remembered an earlier lesson: When we are not enjoying our children, it often means that we are the problem. Rather than railing against them (my default reaction), it became clear that we needed the parenting equivalent of a chiropractic adjustment.</p>
<p>That night after they went to bed, Christopher and I began processing where we had veered off track. It didn&#8217;t take long for us to realize that we carried expectations for who they ought to be and how they should behave that we had never clearly communicated to them. We wondered if we could initiate a conversation that would get us all on the same page.</p>
<p>The next morning over breakfast, Christopher asked, &#8220;What are some of the characteristics that we already have as a family and what are a few areas where we could grow?&#8221; It became one of the most engaging, dynamic conversations that we&#8217;ve ever had! What started as a problem led to a powerful process of solidifying our sense of family identity.</p>

<p>It has always puzzled me why so few Christians are on the vanguard of stewardship and environmental issues. If indeed God created this beautiful earth and then gave us the responsibility of caring for it, shouldn’t we prioritize this alongside of worshiping only one God, not murdering, and keeping the Sabbath? Instead, those of us who consider ourselves Christians tend to let a selective few (Wendell Berry, Eugene Petersen, Calvin DeWitt, Peter and Miranda Harris, among others) do the heaving lifting while we watch from the couch. After reading Leah Kostamo’s book <em>Planted: A Story of Creation, Calling, and Community,</em> I get the sense that maybe, just maybe, that is changing.</p>
<p>Back in 1999, Peter and Miranda Harris (the original founders of A Rocha, Portugal) taught a class called Incarnational Mission at Vancouver’s Regent University. According to Kostamo, “They loved God, they loved people, and they loved creation. . . . For many of us [in the class], their embodiment of faith helped us to shift environmental stewardship from a fringe concern to a thoroughly normal part of our Christian lives.” Not long after, Leah and Markku Kostamo set their sights on establishing a North American version of A Rocha, focused on conservation, education, restoration, community agriculture, and sustainable living. <span id="more-2580"></span></p>
<p>Leah Kostamo chronicles her family’s journey in <em>Planted</em>. Their radical and risky choice to exit the superhighway heading to the American dream of more stuff was based on four core beliefs; the earth is the Lord’s; creation is good; everything is connected; and, we are to have hope. Such visionary thinking has allowed them to integrate stewardship into every component of their lives. They are committed to “caring for all of God’s creation in holistic ways—the more threatened zoological bits, but also the more threatened human bits too.” With the help of staff and volunteers, they preserve the habitat of the Chinook salmon but they also extend themselves to the hundreds of individuals who show up on their doorstep each year. (Kostamo describes A Rocha as, “Youth hostel meets Sierra Club set on an organic farm.”)</p>
<p>I wonder if part of the reason that stewardship has taken so long to appear on Christians’ radar has been the tone that many activists employ. There’s either a shrill, dire, and predictably guilt ridden vibe or an all or nothing gauntlet that tends to alienate potential converts. Not so with Kostamo. In her world, you are free to live out your own convictions; you can consume meat (though she doesn’t), use a clothes dryer (though she doesn’t), or load your dish washer with abandon (as Leah gratefully does). I get the feeling that she exudes God&#8217;s grace and mercy, even as she humbly acknowledges her limitations. “If marriage is a mirror, then intentional community living is a hours of mirrors. The trick to doing it semi-well is to keep loving and forgiving—especially oneself—in the midst of the grind of everyday life.”</p>
<p>This commitment to whole and holy living is rare and it can’t be pulled off without a deep well of hope. “Hope is a rare commodity in the environmental world. . . . Knowing what conservationists know, it’s only logical that they would be tempted to despair. But the Christian way is one of hope.” In Colossians 1:15-20, Paul “links creation and humanity’s redemption through the person of Jesus. Through Christ, all things were created; he sustains all things (holds them together), and then through his resurrection, he reconciles all things. . . . The overarching theme of redemption for all of creation, is meant to root us in hope—a hope centered on God’s ultimate care for what he has made.”</p>
<p>Kostamo’s life radiates a hope that&#8217;s infectious. And not only hope, but also purpose and gratitude. As I turned the pages, I found my commitment to stewardship strengthened and my heart overflowing with thankfulness.</p>
<p>In the midst of winning us over, the author slips in a few confrontations—most notably on the topic of our “addiction to consumption.” Our compulsive consumerism forces us into a viscous cycle of earning more so we can buy more; it also erodes our capacity for gratitude. “When we are satisfied with our lives as being enough, we are able to resist the whispers of consumerism that tell us we don’t have enough or we are not enough.” I firmly believe that consumerism is one of the America&#8217;s root sins. Coupled with entitlement, it leads us to believe we should be able to have whatever we want, regardless of the cost to our souls or others’ well-being. Stewardship as a life-style could free us from this bankrupt pattern.</p>
<p>Though Kostamo is smart enough to realize that few of us will make the radical choices she and her husband have, she does not leave us any wiggle room to ignore God&#8217;s universal call:</p>
<p>“While creation care <em>as a vocation</em> is a specific calling, as a way of life, it is everyone’s calling. Just as every Christian is called to witness to God’s love and to promote justice for those without a voice, so too, all Christians are called to steward creation.”</p>
<p>This is a unique book and the Kostamos are a remarkable family. Perhaps as more of us embrace the whole gospel with all of who we are, Leah and Markku will see their choices joyfully replicated across the globe.</p>
