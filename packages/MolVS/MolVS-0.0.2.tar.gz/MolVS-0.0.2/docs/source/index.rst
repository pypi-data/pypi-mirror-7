MolVS: Molecule Validation and Standardization
==============================================

.. sectionauthor:: Matt Swain <m.swain@me.com>

**MolVS** is a molecule validation and standardization tool, written in Python using the `RDKit chemistry framework`_.

Building a collection of chemical structures from different sources can be difficult due to differing representations,
drawing conventions and mistakes. MolVS can standardize chemical structures to improve data quality, help with
de-duplication and identify relationships between molecules.

There are sensible defaults that make it easy to get started::

    >>> from molvs import standardize_smiles
    >>> standardize_smiles('C2(=C1C(=NC=N1)[NH]C(=N2)N)O')
    'Nc1nc(O)c2ncnc-2[nH]1'

Each standardization module is also available separately, allowing the development of custom standardization processes.

Features
--------

- Normalization of functional groups to a consistent format.
- Recombination of separated charges.
- Breaking of bonds to metal atoms.
- Competitive reionization to ensure strongest acids ionize first in partially ionize molecules.
- Tautomer enumeration and canonicalization.
- Neutralization of charges.
- Standardization or removal of stereochemistry information.
- Filtering of salt and solvent fragments.
- Generation of fragment, isotope, charge, tautomer or stereochemistry insensitive parent structures.
- Validations to identify molecules with unusual and potentially troublesome characteristics.
