        ======
        
        *A webservice that runs docker builds/deployments on docker webhooks*
        
        Rationale: Be able to construct and run docker containers with sensitive
        configs when the unconfigured parent docker image builds.
        
        Super dangerous-ish as it needs to run with access to the docker socket
