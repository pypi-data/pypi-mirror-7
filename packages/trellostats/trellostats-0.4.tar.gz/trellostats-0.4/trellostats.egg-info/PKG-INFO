Description: Trellis - Trello stats for Winners
        ==================================
        
        Trello's cool, but it doesn't have any relevant reporting out of the box. That's what the API's are for.
        
        Trellis provides the following:
        
        1. Cycle Time
        2. Predicted end date.
        3. Statistical process control - how predictable is your process.
        4. Nice csv output for Panic Statusboard
