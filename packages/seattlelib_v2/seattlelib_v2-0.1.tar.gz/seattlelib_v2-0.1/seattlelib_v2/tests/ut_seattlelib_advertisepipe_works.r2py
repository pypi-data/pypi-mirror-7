"""
Verify that advertisepipe works, and its add_to_pipe and remove_handle 
functions do what is expected. For this, let's announce a few keys with 
values, remove handles from keys that are also advertised by other 
handles, etc.

Note that I'm checking the removals against the advertise_dict rather than 
the actual advertise services, because that would involve lots of TTLs' 
worth of waiting.

The initial advertise dict should contain approximately this:
{
key1: { value1: [ handle1 ] },
key2: { value2: [ handle2 ] },
key3: { value3: [ handle3 ] }
}

We'll add a "duplicate key", i.e. announce a different value under an 
existing key so that

    keyZ: { valueY: [ handleX ], valueW: [ handleV ] }

We'll also add a "duplicate item" later on so that for one key/value, there is 
another handle in the list:

    keyA: { valueB: [ handleC, handleD ] }
