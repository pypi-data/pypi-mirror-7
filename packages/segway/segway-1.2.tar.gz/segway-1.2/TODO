ROADMAP:

will gradually move file generation code out of segway/run.py:Runner into Saver
classes. For example, see segway/input_master.py:InputMasterSaver

Remove non-core, undocumented scripts like h5histogram

* fix docs (latexpdf missing, no man target)
* check that recovery files are there (when -r specified) before
  spinning off threads
