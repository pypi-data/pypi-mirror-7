        About
        -----
        
        This library aimed to help those who want to talk to zimbra instance from
        python.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        What is possible at the moment:
        
        * authentication to zimbra using account name and password
        * pre-authentication to zimbra using domain key
        * administrative login to zimbra
        * execute any method via soap by preparing xml request
        * get back proper exception message and code from zimbra
        * use library behind proxy
        
        What is missing and coming in the future:
        
        * zimbra client api: set of python classes to use instead of dealing with xml
          directly
