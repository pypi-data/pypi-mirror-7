Description: What is it?
        ===========
        DHTMLParser is a lightweight HTML/XML parser created for one purpose - quick and easy 
        picking selected tags from DOM.
        
        It can be very useful when you are in need to write own "guerilla" API for some webpage, or a scrapper.
        
        If you want, you can also create HTML/XML documents more easily than by joining strings.
