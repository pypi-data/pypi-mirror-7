pyrax

Python SDK for OpenStack/Rackspace APIs

See the COPYING file for license and copyright information.

pyrax should work with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments, though it specifically targets the Rackspace public cloud. For example, the code for cloudfiles contains the ability to publish your content on Rackspace's CDN network, even though CDN support is not part of OpenStack Swift. But if you don't use any of the CDN-related code, your app will work fine on any standard Swift deployment.

See the Release Notes for what has changed in the latest release

* Installation
The best way to install pyrax is by using pip to get the latest official release:

    pip install pyrax

If you would like to work with the current development state of pyrax, you can install directly from trunk on GitHub:

    pip install git+git://github.com/rackspace/pyrax.git

If you are not using virtualenv, you will need to run pip install as admin using sudo.

You may also download and install from source. The source code for pyrax is available on GitHub.

Once you have the source code, cd to the base directory of the source and run (using sudo, if necessary):

    python setup.py install


* Updates
If you installed pyrax using pip, it is simple to get the latest updates from either PyPI or GitHub:

    # PyPI
    pip install --upgrade pyrax
    # GitHub
    pip install --upgrade git+git://github.com/rackspace/pyrax.git
