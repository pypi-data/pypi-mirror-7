Description: 
        This is the long-period ephemeris which is used by the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory's online HORIZONS service for dates far in the past or
        future.

        This ephemeris is like `DE405 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de405>`_ but
        covers a longer time period.  To keep its files from being too large,
        its size was reduced by permitting up to 1 meter of interpolation error
        for the position of the Moon, and 25 meters for all other solar system
        bodies.  Since DE405 itself is often only accurate to within a few
        kilometers for planetary positions, the difference was not important for
        many users.  You can get much higher accuracy from the more recent
        long-term ephemeris `DE422 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de422>`_ but at
        the cost of three times the RAM and disk space.
        
        To compute using this ephemeris in Python, see the `jplephem
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jplephem>`_ package.
