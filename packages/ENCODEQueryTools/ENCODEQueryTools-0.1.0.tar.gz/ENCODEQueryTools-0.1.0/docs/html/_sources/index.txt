============================================
Welcome to ENCODEQueryTools' documentation!
============================================

The ENCODEQueryTools package contains modules that support the querying of ENCODE ChIP-Seq data. At the moment, the only module in this package is ENCODEQT, which allows programmatic access to the resources underlying the ENCODE ChIP-Seq Significance Tool (http://encodeqt.stanford.edu). The tool is designed to identify enriched transcription factors from ENCODE Consortium ChIP-Seq experiments given a list of genes or transcripts.

Please note that this tool is not directly affiliated with the ENCODE consortium (http://www.genome.gov/encode). We welcome any contributions from the developer community, be they additional libraries useful for leveraging ENCODE consortium data, tools that leverage these data, or general support. ENCODE data is currently very hard to access and we hope that this package will help unlock this vast resource for everyone.
