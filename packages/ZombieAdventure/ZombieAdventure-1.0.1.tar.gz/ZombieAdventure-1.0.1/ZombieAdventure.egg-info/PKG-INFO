        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. Using `setup.py` to install from source:
        
        	python setup.py install
        
        2. Fetching from __pip__:

        Start the game
        --------------
        
        New shell binary will be added. Just type `zombieadv` to start the game.
        Look where you run the game from! Save files have `.sav` extension and are saved in the current dir.
        
        
        Playing the game
        ----------------
        
        You use prompt to put in commands for your character. Unlike other text-based input games, you don't really use verbs (only occasionally) - instead you type name of things.
        
        For more information you can type `help` in the game (except battles) to bring up this help screen:
        
        	LOOK: See where you can go.
        	HINT: If you're stuck, you can get little help.
        	SAVE: Save your progress.
        	INV: Will display contents of your inventory.
        	CHAR: Shows character stats.
        	HEAL: Will heal your char if you have bandage(s).
        	QUIT: Quit game.
