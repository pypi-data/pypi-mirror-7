Toga
====

A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

Quickstart
----------

To get a demonstration of the capabilities of Toga, run the following::

    $ pip install toga-demo
    $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window with some sample widgets.

Problems using virtualenv under Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toga uses the system native python GTK+3 bindings for display purposes.
However, if you're using a `--no-site-packages` virtualenv, the Python bindings
for GTK won't be in your `PYTHONPATH`.

Unfortunately, you can't `pip install` GTK+ bindings, so you have to use a
workaround. To make the system GTK+ bindings available to your virtualenv,
symlinking the `gi` module from the system dist-packages directory into your
virtualenv's site-packages:

    $ cd <your virtualenv dir>/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    $ ln -si /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi
