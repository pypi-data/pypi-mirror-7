Description: pit-- Python as a stream filter
        =======================================
        
        What's new in version 0.2
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * NOTE: expression evaluation is now default; -e now stands for _execute_
        * -b flag can be used to execute code before loop
        * optional positonal statement after loop
        
        What's new in version 0.1.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * Lines of standard input can be split up by a field separator.
        * -e flag evaluates command as an expression.
        
        Pit is a tool for making it easier to run Python on the command line.
        It is designed to be a swiss army knife for people who aren't as familiar with
        (or who don't want to deal with) the entire array of Unix utilities.
        
        Example uses:
        -------------
        
        Quick calculator
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ::
            pit ".97**12"
        
        
        Prints out words per line
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Lines of standard input are piped into the underscore variable, _
        ::
            cat document.txt | pit "len(_)"
        
        Filter lines
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ::
            cat document.csv | pit -f 'len(_) > 10'
        
        Count unique occurences of lines in a document:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The -e flag causes pit to execute the code, rather than evaluate it.
        The -b flag (--begin) allows initialization code to be set up.
        An optional positional argument after the main code section is run after the input ends.
        ::
            cat redundant.txt | pit -e -b 'a=set()' 'a.add(_)' 'print len(a)'
