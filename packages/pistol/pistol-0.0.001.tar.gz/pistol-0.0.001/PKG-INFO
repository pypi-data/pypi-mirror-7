        ======
        
        A python package utility to make packaging, sharing, installing, and managing
        libraries simpler.
        
        Using Pip and requirements.txt has sufficed for python development thus far,
        though is lacking in comparison to tools such as Gem and NPM. For example,
        NPM allows a developer to distinguish between production and development
        dependancies. This functionality is not conveniently baked into Pip. Pistol
        is driven by a `package.yaml` file that contains a map of `tag`s to lists of
        dependencies. Dependencies may then be installed using
        `pistol install[=tag] [package]`.
        
        ## Commands
        
        ### init
        
        Creates a basic pistol python package.
        
        ### install
        
        Installs a python package from PyPi.
        
        `pistol install[=tag] [package] --save=[tag]``
        
        #### Arguements
        
        - --save=[key]
        
        ### uninstall
        
        Removes a Python package.
        
        ### upload
        
        Upload a package to PyPi.
        
        #### Arguements
        
        - --user=[pypi_username]
        - --pass=[pypi_password]
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install pistol`
        
        ## Potential Aliases

        - shoot
        
        ## package.yaml
        
        The `package.yaml` is structured as follows.
        
        ```yaml
