        Term based tool to view *colored*, *incremental* diff in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn*
        workspace or from stdin, with *side by side* and *auto pager* support. Requires
        python (>= 2.5.0) and ``less``.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with pip
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Cdiff is already listed on `PyPI`_, you can install with ``pip`` if you have
        the tool.
        
        .. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cdiff
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install --upgrade cdiff
        
        Install with setup.py
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can also run the setup.py from the source if you don't have ``pip``.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/ymattw/cdiff.git
            cd cdiff
            ./setup.py install
        
        Download directly
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Just save `cdiff.py`_ to whatever directory which is in your ``$PATH``, for
        example, ``$HOME/bin`` is in my ``$PATH``, so I save the script there and name
        as ``cdiff``.
        
        .. _`cdiff.py`: https://raw.github.com/ymattw/cdiff/master/cdiff.py
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            curl -ksSL https://raw.github.com/ymattw/cdiff/master/cdiff.py > ~/bin/cdiff
            chmod +x ~/bin/cdiff
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Type ``cdiff -h`` to show usage::
        
            $ cdiff -h
            Usage: cdiff [options] [file|dir ...]
        
            View colored, incremental diff in a workspace or from stdin, with side by side
            and auto pager support
        
            Options:
              --version           show program's version number and exit
              -h, --help          show this help message and exit
              -s, --side-by-side  enable side-by-side mode
              -w N, --width=N     set text width for side-by-side mode, 0 for auto
                                  detection, default is 80
              -l, --log           show log with changes from revision control
              -c M, --color=M     colorize mode 'auto' (default), 'always', or 'never'
        
              Note:
                Option parser will stop on first unknown option and pass them down to
                underneath revision control
        
        Read diff from local modification in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace (output
        from e.g. ``git diff``, ``svn diff``):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            cd proj-workspace
            cdiff                       # view colored incremental diff
            cdiff -s                    # view side by side, use default text width 80
            cdiff -s -w 90              # use text width 90 other than default 80
            cdiff -s -w 0               # auto set text width based on terminal size
            cdiff -s file1 dir2         # view modification of given files/dirs only
            cdiff -s -w90 -- -U10       # pass '-U10' to underneath revision diff tool
            cdiff -s -w90 -U10          # '--' is optional as it's unknown to cdiff
            cdiff -s --cached           # show git staged diff (git diff --cached)
            cdiff -s -r1234             # show svn diff to revision 1234
        
        Read log with changes in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace (output from e.g.
        ``git log -p``, ``svn log --diff``), note *--diff* option is new in svn 1.7.0:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            cd proj-workspace
            cdiff -l                    # read log along with changes
            cdiff -ls                   # equivalent to cdiff -l -s, view side by side
            cdiff -ls -w90              # set text width 90 as well
            cdiff -ls file1 dir2        # see log with changes of given files/dirs only
        
        Pipe in a diff:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git log -p -2 | cdiff       # view git log with changes of last 2 commits
            git show 15bfa | cdiff -s   # view a given git commit, side by side
            svn diff -r1234 | cdiff -s  # view svn diff comparing to given revision
            diff -u file1 file2 | cdiff # view diff between two files (note the '-u')
            diff -ur dir1 dir2 | cdiff  # view diff between two dirs
        
            # View diff in a GitHub pull request, side by side
            curl https://github.com/ymattw/cdiff/pull/11.diff | cdiff -s
        
            # View a patch file in unified or context format, the latter depends on
            # command `filterdiff` from package `patchutils` which is available in
            # major Linux distros and MacPorts.
            #
            cdiff -s < foo.patch
        
        Redirect output to another patch file is safe:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            svn diff -r PREV | cdiff -s > my.patch
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Cdiff has following known issues:
        
        - Does not recognize `normal` diff, and depends on ``filterdiff`` (patchutils)
          to read `context` diff
        - Side by side mode has alignment problem for wide chars
        - Terminal might be in a mess on exception (type ``reset`` can fix it)
        
        Pull requests are very welcome, please make sure your changes can pass unit
        tests and regression tests by run ``make test`` (required tool *coverage* can
        be installed with ``pip install coverage``).  Also watch out `travis build`_
        after push, make sure it passes as well.

        I have another tool `coderev`_ which generates side-by-side diff pages for code
        review from two given files or directories, I found it's not easy to extend to
        support git so invented `cdiff`.  Idea of ansi color markup is also from
        project `colordiff`_.
