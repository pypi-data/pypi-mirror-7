A pure python splay tree class is provided.  It is
thoroughly unit tested, passes pylint, and is known
to run on CPython 2.x, CPython 3.x, Pypy 2.2 and
Jython 2.7b1.

This splay tree looks like a dictionary that's always
sorted by key.  It also reorganizes itself on every
get and put, to optimize subsequent operations on the
same key.  For this reason, splay trees are frequently
used for caches.
