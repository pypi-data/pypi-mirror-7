Description: 
        A pure python splay tree class is provided.  It is
        thoroughly unit tested, passes pylint, and is known
        to run on CPython 2.x, CPython 3.x, Pypy 2.2 and
        Jython 2.7b1.
        
        This splay tree looks like a dictionary that's always
        sorted by key.  It also reorganizes itself on every
        get and put, to optimize subsequent operations on the
        same key.  For this reason, splay trees are frequently
        used for caches.
