P4N 2014: Python for Neuroscience (and Psychology)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do you want to get started using Python_ (and PsychoPy_) for your studies in behavioural sciences? Maybe you keep meaning to switch from another package and haven't gotten around to it. This workshop will get you off the ground with building and analysing your experiments using Python.

`Python`_ is a powerful well-designed programming language that's totally free and runs on all operating systems. It's a little like a free replacement for Matlab, but with more flexibility and better syntax!

`PsychoPy`_ is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use software package for conducting studies in psychophysics, neuroimaging and experimental psychology. It's become the package of choice in very many labs worldwide (see `PsychoPy usage stats <http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php>`_). It comes with a graphical interface (Builder) as well as a `Python` scripting interface (Coder), which will be the primary focus at this workshop.

    :When: 28 April - 30 April May (inclusive)
    :Where: School of Psychology, University of Nottingham
    :Cost: Â£300
    :Includes: Refreshments and lunch. Accommodation is not included but can be booked cheaply via the University Accommodation Office (details on booking)
    :Content:
        Material will cover *Python* programming basics as well as PsychoPy-specific coding. Note that this is not a workshop about PsychoPy Builder; we'll really be focussing on programming.
        
    Bookings can be made now at `Nottingham's online store <http://store.nottingham.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&catid=49&prodid=323>`_. Places are limited but a waiting list will be maintained if you are unable to get onto the course.

Beginner stream
------------------------

Suitable for non-programmers and for convertees from Matlab:

    - basic Python programming 
    - running experiments in PsychoPy using code
    - analysing and plotting your data
    
Intermediate stream
------------------------

Assumes you already understand basic Python syntax). This is subject to change but we will be looking at topics like:

    - writing efficient code
    - functions and classes
    - extending PsychoPy Builder
    - using source control
    - data plotting
    - some specific use-cases (e.g. eye-tracking, neuroimaging, EEG)

Both streams will include a mixture of demonstrations, self-paced exercises and time for users to create their own experiments in the software.
