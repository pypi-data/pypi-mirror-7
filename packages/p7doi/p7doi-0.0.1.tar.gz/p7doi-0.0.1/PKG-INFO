        **p7doi** is a tool for `Paris 7`_ students who read research papers outside the
        university. A lot of them are behind a paywall, which can be bypassed by using
        the university’s proxy because it’s subscribed to a bunch of these websites.
        
        Note: you’ll need to login with your student credentials when asked to.

        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install p7doi
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block::
        
            p7doi <doi>
        
        It’ll open the article in your default web browser. Note that you might need to
        put the DOI between quotes if it contains characters that could be interpreted
        by your shell (e.g. parentheses).
