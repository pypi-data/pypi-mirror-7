        ------------------
        
        * Use unique id for host string to avoid issues.

        * Added ``fab`` command which is just a wrapper for Fabric with all it's options
          and reworked ``do`` command into a simple version to just run a task.

        1.0b3 - 2014-06-09
        ------------------
        
        * When depending on Fabric, skip 1.8.3 which added a version pin on paramiko.
          [fschulze]
        
        * Only add Fabric to install_requires if it can't be imported. That way we
          don't get problems if it's already installed as a system packages or in a
          virtualenv.

        * Use context manager for output filtering and filter in ``do`` helper.
          [fschulze]
