# Rationale for disabling certain checks.
#  - old-style-class: only support "modern" Python versions
#  - no-init: not all classes require instance-based initialization
#  - abstract-class-not-used: this is a library that exports such things
#  - pointless-string-statement: triggered by docstrings of class-level bindings
