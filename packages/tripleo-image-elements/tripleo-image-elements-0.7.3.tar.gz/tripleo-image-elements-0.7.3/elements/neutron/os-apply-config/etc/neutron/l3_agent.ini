## NB: Unpolished config file
## This config file was taken directly from the upstream repo, and tweaked just enough to work.
## It has not been audited to ensure that everything present is either Heat controlled or a mandatory as-is setting.
## Please submit patches for any setting that should be deleted or Heat-configurable.
