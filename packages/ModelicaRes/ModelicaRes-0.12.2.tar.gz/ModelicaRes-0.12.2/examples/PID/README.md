This folder contains [lin.py](lin.py), which generates a Dymola script to
linearize Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.PID from the [Modelica Standard Library]
with various parameter settings and plots the results.  The results are
generated here, but only the \*.mat files are included in the distribution.
