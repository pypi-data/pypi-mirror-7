**Python utilities to set up and analyze Modelica simulation experiments**

ModelicaRes is a free, open-source tool to manage Modelica_ simulations,
interpret results, and create publishable figures.  It is possible to

- Auto-generate simulation scripts,
- Browse data,
- Perform custom calculations, and
- Produce various plots and diagrams.

The figures are generated via matplotlib_, which offers a rich set of plotting
routines.  ModelicaRes includes convenient functions to automatically pre-format
and label some figures, like xy plots, Bode and Nyquist plots, and Sankey
diagrams.  ModelicaRes can be scripted or run from a Python_ interpreter with
math and matrix functions from NumPy_.

  The links below and in the sidebar describe the components of ModelicaRes.
  For an introduction, please see :mod:`loadres`, which loads data files and
  provides a Python_ interpreter to help analyze them.

  The following chapters describe the components of ModelicaRes.  For an
  introduction, please see :mod:`loadres`, which loads data files and provides a
  Python_ interpreter to help analyze them.

  The top-level module, :mod:`modelicares`, provides direct access to the most
  important classes and functions.  Others must be accessed through their
  submodules.  The :mod:`modelicares.simres` submodule has classes to load,
  analyze, and plot simulation results.  The :mod:`modelicares.linres` submodule
  has a class to load, analyze, and plot results from linearizing a model.  The
  :mod:`modelicares.multi` submodule has functions to load and plot results from
  multiple data files at once. The :mod:`modelicares.exps` submodule has tools
  to set up and manage simulation experiments.  The :mod:`modelicares.texunit`
  submodule has functions to translate Modelica_ *unit* and *displayUnit*
  strings into LaTeX_-formatted strings.  The last submodule,
  :mod:`modelicares.base`, has general supporting functions.

  **Installation**

  The easiest way to install this package is to use pip_::

      pip install modelicares

  On Linux, it may be necessary to have root privileges::

      sudo pip install modelicares

  Another way is to download and extract a copy of the package from the 
  `main project site`_, the `master branch at GitHub 
  <https://github.com/kdavies4/ModelicaRes>`_, or the `PyPI page`_.  Run 
  the following command from the base folder::

      python setup.py install

  Or, on Linux::

      sudo python setup.py install

  The *matplotlibrc* file in the base folder has some recommended revisions to
  matplotlib_'s defaults.  To use it, copy or move it to the working directory
  or matplotlib_'s configuration directory.  See
  http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.
