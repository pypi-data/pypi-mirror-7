Flask-Edits
~~~~~~~~~~~

"Can't you just, rewrite it to sound more *edgy?*"

Clients blowing up your phone to change some copy on the ``/about``
page?

Enter **Flask-Edits**. Mark sections of your templates with
``{% editable %}`` and their content is exposed in a slick admin panel.
Never worry about tweaking copy again.

Usage
^^^^^

::

    from flask.ext.edits import Edits

    app = Flask(__name__)
    edits = Edits(app)

All edits are saved to the disk as JSON, so configure a path to save the
edits. Edits can be commited to version control along with the rest of
the app.

::

    import os.path as op
    app.config['EDITS_PATH'] = op.join(op.dirname(op.abspath(__file__)), 'edits.json')

Mark sections of your Jinja templates as editable. The section name is
required, it's used as the section label when editing and the key that
the edits are stored under.

::

    {% editable 'Section name' %}
    Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
    {% endeditable %}

**Important:**

There is no automatic detection of editable sections (yet). You have to
visit the URL that renders the template to register it as editable. It
will not show up in the admin panel until it has been rendered with
``render_template``.

Admin
^^^^^

The Flask-Edits admin view is exposed by default at ``/edits``. This can
be changed in the configuration:

::

    app.config['EDITS_URL'] = '/edits'

**Note on security:**

Like Flask-Admin, Flask-Edits does not make any assumptions about the
authentication system you might be using. So, by default, the admin
interface is completely open. Protect it behind basic auth or another
form of authentication.

Editing
^^^^^^^

All pages that have registered editable sections are available to edit
in the interface. At this time, only static HTML is supported. Support
for Jinja2 is on the roadmap.

The `Summernote <http://hackerwins.github.io/summernote/>`__ HTML editor
is included but not used by default. To enable it:

::

    app.config['EDITS_SUMMERNOTE'] = True

When content is saved it instantly updates the Jinja context and writes
to the JSON file on the server.

Within a page, multiple sections with the same name will only show up
once in the admin panel, but the edits will be applied to each section.

Clearing a section will revert it to the original content in the
template.

Roadmap
^^^^^^^

-  Automatically register editable sections
-  Jinja2 content with context evaluation
-  Preview edits
-  Multiple database backends
-  In-place page editing
