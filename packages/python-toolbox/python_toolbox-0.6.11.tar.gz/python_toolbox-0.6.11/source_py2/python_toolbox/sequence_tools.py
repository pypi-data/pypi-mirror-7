    Partition `sequence` into equal partitions of size `partition_size`, or
    determine size automatically given the number of partitions as
    `n_partitions`.

    If the sequence can't be divided into precisely equal partitions, the last
    partition will contain less members than all the other partitions.

    Example:

        >>> partitions([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
        [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4]]

    (You need to give *either* a `partition_size` *or* an `n_partitions`
    argument, not both.)

    Specify `allow_remainder=False` to enforce that the all the partition sizes
    be equal; if there's a remainder while `allow_remainder=False`, an
    exception will be raised.

    If you want the remainder partition to be of equal size with the other
    partitions, you can specify `fill_value` as the padding for the last
    partition. A specified value for `fill_value` implies
    `allow_remainder=True` and will cause an exception to be raised if
    specified with `allow_remainder=False`.

    Example:

    This function figures out whether the user entered a sequence of items, in
    which case it will only be converted to a tuple and returned; or the user
    entered a single item, in which case a tuple `(item,)` will be returned.

    To aid this function in parsing, you may optionally specify `item_type`
    which is the type of the items, or alternatively `item_test` which is a
    callable that takes an object and returns whether it's a valid item. These
    are necessary only when your items might be sequences themselves.
    
    You may optionally put multiple types in `item_type`, and each object would
