Version 1.4, 2006-01-27
-----------------------

- Add capability to merge pages from multiple PDF files into a single page
  using the PageObject.mergePage function.  See example code (README or web
  site) for more information.

- Add ability to modify a page's MediaBox, CropBox, BleedBox, TrimBox, and
  ArtBox properties through PageObject.  See example code (README or web site)
  for more information.

- Refactor pdf.py into multiple files: generic.py (contains objects like
  NameObject, DictionaryObject), filters.py (contains filter code),
  utils.py (various).  This does not affect importing PdfFileReader
  or PdfFileWriter.

- Add new decoding functions for standard PDF filters ASCIIHexDecode and
  ASCII85Decode.

- Change url and download_url to refer to new pybrary.net web site.


Version 1.3, 2006-01-23
-----------------------

- Fix new bug introduced in 1.2 where PDF files with \r line endings did not
  work properly anymore.  A new test suite developed with various PDF files
  should prevent regression bugs from now on.

- Fix a bug where inheriting attributes from page nodes did not work.


Version 1.2, 2006-01-23
-----------------------

- Improved support for files with CRLF-based line endings, fixing a common
  reported problem stating "assertion error: assert line == "%%EOF"".

- Software author/maintainer is now officially a proud married person, which
  is sure to result in better software... somehow.


Version 1.1, 2006-01-18
-----------------------

- Add capability to rotate pages.

- Improved PDF reading support to properly manage inherited attributes from
  /Type=/Pages nodes.  This means that page groups that are rotated or have
  different media boxes or whatever will now work properly.

- Added PDF 1.5 support.  Namely cross-reference streams and object streams.
  This release can mangle Adobe's PDFReference16.pdf successfully.


Version 1.0, 2006-01-17
-----------------------

- First distutils-capable true public release.  Supports a wide variety of PDF
  files that I found sitting around on my system.

- Does not support some PDF 1.5 features, such as object streams,
  cross-reference streams.
