Stellar - Fast database snapshots for development. It's like Git for databases.
=======

Stellar allows you to quickly restore database when you are e.g. writing database migrations, switching branches or messing with SQL. PostreSQL and MySQL are supported.

How to get started
-------

You can install Stellar with `pip`.

```$ pip install stellar```

After that, you should go to your project folder and initialize Stellar settings. Stellar initialization wizard will help you with that.

```$ stellar init```

Stellar settings are saved as 'stellar.yaml' so you probably want to add that to your `.gitignore`.

```$ echo stellar.yaml >> .gitignore```

Done! :dancers:
