0.9
======

* First fully functional build
* Walks a directory tree creating sitemap.xmls per directory, ignoring paths containing 'testing' or 'sitemap.xml'
* Adds data from HTML meta tags to sitemap entries, creates tags named by the meta tag's id (as opposed to Google standard, which uses the name attribute); this has to do with 'getbyid' in javascript, and 
* Implemented functionally
