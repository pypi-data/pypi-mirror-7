Description: ======
        bdt_sitemap
        ======
        
        BDT Sitemap is a sitemap.xml generator for local copies of websites. It follows the official Sitemap protocol: http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html
        
        The protocol is extended in one way for convenience; HTML files containing meta tags with the 'id' and 'content' attributes will have their data added to their sitemap entries. This can be very useful in having tools navigate a site and act based on page content, without actually loading the pages. There are many ways to use this functionality, I choose to use it to define a corner image for each page, and if undefined the corner image used by the parent directory's index.html page is used.
        
        BDT Sitemap can be called as a library by importing bdt.sitemap, and calling create_sitemap, or by being run standalone as bdt_sitemap. Arguments are detailed below.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        BDT Sitemap requires Python 2.6 or 2.7, and beautiful soup 4 (automatically installed by pip if you pip install).
        
        Term Definitions
        ================
        
        For conciseness, here are some terms with specific definitions when used here in this Readme:
        
        Item: A file or directory encountered while 
        
        Usage
        =====
        Can be used as a library, or run standalone in the command line.
        
        
        Supports two arguments:
        
        	Domain:		In url form, the domain name for which you're generating sitemaps. Subdomains are also supported. Each domain and subdomain must be run separately. 'domain.com' and 'subdomain.domain.ru' are both valid.
        
        	LocalPath:	Path to the website directory as stored locally. Platform agnostic.
        
        WARNING: If the LocalPath argument is not passed, current directory will be assumed! You will be asked if this was a mistake, and given a chance to exit, but that's all! You will end up with sitemap.xmls all over the place if you're not careful!
        
        
        Usage:
        
        	bdt_sitemap mysite.com ~/sites/sitefolder
        
        	bdt_sitemap tadeuszow.com /home/xenmen/sites/Tadeuszow-site/main
        
        	bdt_sitemap daniel.tadeuszow.com C:\Users\Xenmen\sites\Tadeuszow-site\daniel
        
        
        Usage as a library in WIP, and presently creates a global variable called emod_time, and defines three functions:
        
        	init_emod_time()
        
        	compare_emod_time(newtime)
        
        	create_sitemap(domain, site_dir, ignorelist=[])
        
        
        Only create_sitemap should ever be called, the other two are internal functions. Ignorelist is only supported in the library functionality, standalone functionality is WIP. Ignorelist is a list of strings, which, if found in the path to a file or directory, that directory will be skipped, and if in the name of a file or directory, then that file or directory will
        
        It is recommended to use bdt_sitemap standalone, and not as a library, until version 1.0.
