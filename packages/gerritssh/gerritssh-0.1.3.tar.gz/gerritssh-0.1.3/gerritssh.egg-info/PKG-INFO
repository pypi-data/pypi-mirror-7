        Python package wrapping the Gerrit command line API.
        
        This is very much a work in progress, and intended to be the basis
        for building more sophisticated scripts and applications, for example
        automating complex work flows in large projects.
        
        Rationale
        ---------
        
        This project was started as a test-bed for me to explore the wider
        world of Python, such as:
        
        * Unit testing
        * Continuous Integration
        * Sphinx rst documentation
        * tox, flake8, etc.
        * Supporting multiple versions of Python.
        * Pythonic style
        
        Basically, everything that goes into making an industrial-strength Python
        library or application. So you are going to see novice mistakes and code
        which is not idiomatic. 
        
        All contributions and suggestions are welcome, and indeed that's the logic
        behind making this open source. I want to learn from the experience of those
        who've been there before me.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Handles the low-level details of the gerrit SSH command line syntax.
        
        * Makes the results of those commands available to the programmer in a
          format which is more natural for Python programmers to manipulate.
        
        * Is aware of which combinations of commands and versions are supported
          for versions of Gerrit from 2.4 through 2.8.
          
        * Supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4
        
        
        Planned Features
        ----------------
        
        * Support a broad range of commands including the latest commands for Gerrit
          v2.8 (such as ls-members)
        
        * Add a module to operate on sets of Review objects to perform more
          complex searches, such as building dependency graphs of open reviews.
          
        * Add support for the administrators ``gsql`` command
        
          * Implement queries such as examining the audit trail on group membership
          
          * Wrapping generation of properly quoted SQL statements
          
          * Extract the SCHEMA information with a ``\d`` command and dynamically
            clone the database into a memory-resident sqlite database.
            
        * Implement support for the stream-events command, serving up events
          using an observer-pattern approach to allow many threads to consume
          events.

        Release Notes
        =============
        
        0.1.3 (2014-06-04)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixes #4 - Unit tests are not sufficient
        
          Added a baseline set of unit tests which perform end-to-end validation
          against a live Gerrit instance if GSSH_TEST_INSTANCE is set in the 
          environment.
        
        * Corrects a bug found in the ssh client disconnect function by the new
          tests.
        
        * Adds new and extended make targets to better clean and test the package.
        
        * Updated documentation accordingly, including expanded testing information.
        
        * Removed ``pypi`` from the list of environments used on travis-ci.
        
          The tests all run fine under pypi locally, but something in travis's
          pypi environment seems to be broken since they started supporting
          Python 3.4.
        
        0.1.2 (2014-06-03)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixes #1 - gsshcli.py requires __version__ attribute
        
          Moved VERSION.py to inside the package so the metadata is avaialable to
          the package and its clients, then modified setup.py and conf.py to use
          execfile to read the data for their own purposes.
        
        * Fixes #2 - gsshcli.py query command fails when --limit option used 
        
          The demo script now reconstitues all option arguments as strings.
          
        * Fixes #3 - Query command throws TypeError under Python2.7
        
          The JSON responses from the query command are correctly converted to
          strings in Python 2.x.
          
        * Initiates unit-test coverage reporting via coveralls.io
        
        0.1.1 (2014-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        * Minor tweak for pip install
        
        0.1.0 (2014-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
