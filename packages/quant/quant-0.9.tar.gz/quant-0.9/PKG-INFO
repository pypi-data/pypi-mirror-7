Description: Welcome to Quant
        ----------------
        
        Quant is an enterprise software application for quantitative analysis.
        Quant combines `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ and
        `DomainModel <http://appropriatesoftware.net/domainmodel/Home.html>`_.
        
        Quant contains a domain model which has exchanges, symbols, markets,
        price histories, price processes, images, books, contracts of different
        types, pricers, pricing preferences, and reports.
        
        Quant has a domain-specific language (Quant DSL) for expressing and
        evaluating contracts in a generic manner.
        
        Quant has a Web user interface, and an API for machine clients. Quant has a
        flexible role-based access controller. There is a Web admin interface, and
        also command line programs to support site setup and administration.
        
        Quant can be extended by adding new price processes, custom contract types,
        and alternative pricers. Quant is currently distributed with a Black Scholes
        price process. There are contract types for American, Binary, European,
        Futures, and for expressing contracts with Quant DSL. There are pricers
        implementing the Monte Carlo, binomial tree, and Black Scholes methods. There
        is a pricer for contract types based on the Quant DSL which involves the
        Longstaff Schwartz least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method.
        
        Other features we are planning to implement include:
        
            * Market prices pulled from exchange APIs;
            * Integration with common spreadsheet applications;
            * State machine enhancements to DSL;
            * Different price processes (e.g local volatility).
        
        If you would like to suggest a feature, please get in touch!

        Install Guide
        -------------
        
        Welcome to the Quant Install Guide.
        
        It is very easy to create new Quant services. Either do it all manually or
        use the Quant installer. Afterwards, simply configure and restart Apache.
        
        The Quant installer will deploy Quant into a new virtual Python environment.
        New services are set up with an SQLite database. Installer options exist
        for using other database management systems, and it is possible to migrate
        between different database management system after the service is created.
        
        
        Operating System Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Before installation, make sure required system packages are installed::
        
            $ sudo aptitude install python python-numpy python-scipy sqlite3
        
        If you are using Python 2.5, you will also need a few other packages:: 
        
            $ sudo aptitude install build-essential python-dev libsqlite3-dev
        
        Check your Python can load scipy with (returns silently if available)::
        
            $ python -c "import numpy"
            $ python -c "import scipy"
        
        Please note, if you will install Quant into an isolated virtual Python
        environment (e.g. with virtualenv), you will want to create library links
        to the Python packages for SciPy (and NumPy) before installing Quant.
        
        
        Manual Code Install
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install the Quant Python package (and dependencies) either by running::
        
            $ pip install quant
        
        Or by downloading the Quant tarball, unpacking and running::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        After installation, please read the following help pages for more information::
        
            $ quant-makeconfig --help
            $ quant-admin help setup
        
        
        Manual Site Setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Decide a filesystem path for the new site::
        
            $ mkdir PATH
        
        Create the new site configuration file::
        
            $ quant-makeconfig --master-dir=PATH  PATH/quant.conf
        
        Set up the new site with the new configuration::
        
            $ quant-admin setup --config=PATH/quant.conf
        
        Please note, if you installed Quant into an isolated virtual Python
        environment, you will want to use the --virtualenv-bin-dir option of
        quant-makeconfig.
        
        The configuration file defines the filesystem path to the newly generated
        Apache configuration file. You will need to need to include this file in the
        main Apache configuration.
        
        
        Automated Install and Deploy
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can create a Quant service in one step with the Quant installer.
        
        The installer will build a virtual Python environment, and install
        the Quant software. The installer will then set up a new site with an SQLite
        database, and it will create an Apache config file to be included in the main
        Apache configuration (see below).
        
        Download the Quant installer (and make it executable)::
        
            $ curl -O http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/docs/quant-virtualenv
            $ chmod +x quant-virtualenv
        
        Run the Quant installer. Note that the PATH folder should never be
        under DocumentRoot of the Apache installation or any other directory
        exposed via Apache web server::
        
            $ ./quant-virtualenv PATH
        
        Please note, the path argument is required (and can be relative or absolute).
        
        After the installer has completed, continue by configuring Apache with a new
        VirtualHost, check file ownership and permissions, and restart.
        
        The installer will diplay the filesystem path to the newly generated Apache
        configuration file. You will need to need to include this file in the main
        Apache configuration.
        
        
        Apache Configuration Steps
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Make sure the required system packages are installed::
        
            $ sudo aptitude install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi 
        
        Also, make sure Apache mod_wsgi is enabled::
        
            $ sudo a2enmod wsgi
        
        Pick a domain name for your site. Create a new virtual host which includes
        the Quant Apache configuration (path mentioned by the installer).
        
        Print the path to the Quant Apache configuration file with::
        
            $ quant-admin www path --config PATH/etc/quant.conf
        
        A new Apache virtual host could simply look like this::
        
            <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerName YOUR-QUANT-SITE
                Include PATH/var/httpd-autogenerated.conf
                WSGIDaemonProcess quant threads=25 maximum-requests=1000
            </VirtualHost>
        
        Please note, the path to the auto-generated file must be an absolute path (not
        a relative path).
        
        If necessary, configure your DNS for YOUR-QUANT-SITE.
        
        
        File Ownership
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Change ownership of Quant files to Apache (or to the user which the WSGI
        daemon process runs as)::
        
            $ chown -R {www-user}:{www-user} PATH
        
        
        Restart Apache
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Once everything is configured, try to restart Apache::
        
            $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
            
        Your virtual host will show a page saying 'Welcome to Quant'.
        
        Login with username 'admin' and password 'pass'.
