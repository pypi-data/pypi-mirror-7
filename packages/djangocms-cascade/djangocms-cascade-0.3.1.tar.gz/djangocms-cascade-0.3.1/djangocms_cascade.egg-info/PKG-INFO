Description: djangocms-cascade
        =================
        
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** is the successor of **DjangoCMS-Bootstrap** which
        is still available under this `repository
        branch <https://github.com/jrief/djangocms-cascade/tree/bootstrap-2.3.2>`__.
        
        Add DOM elements to a Django-CMS placeholder
        --------------------------------------------
        
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** is a collection of plugins for DjangoCMS >3.0 to
        add various HTML elements from CSS frameworks, such as `Twitter
        Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__ or the `960 Grid
        System <http://960.gs/>`__ to any CMS
        `placeholder <http://docs.django-cms.org/en/develop/getting_started/tutorial.html#creating-templates>`__.
        Currently **Bootstrap-3.x** and **960.gs** are supported, but this
        module makes it very easy to add your preferred CSS frameworks. It is
        also very easy to extend an existing collection with additional
        elements.
        
        **DjangoCMS-Cascade** allows web editors to layout their pages, without
        having to edit Django templates. In most cases, one template with one
        single placeholder is enough. The editor then can subdivide that
        placeholder into rows and columns, and add additional elements such as
        buttons, rulers, or even the Bootstrap Carousel.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Use the scaffolding technique from the preferred CSS framework to
           subdivide a placeholder into a `grid
           system <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid>`__.
        -  Make full usage of responsive techniques, by allowing `stacked to
           horizontal <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic>`__
           classes per element.
        -  Use styled `buttons <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons>`__ to add
           links.
        -  Wrap special content into a
           `Jumbotron <http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron>`__ or a
           `Carousel <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel>`__
        -  Add `thumbnails <http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails>`__
           and images in a responsive way.
        -  It is very easy to integrate additional elements from the preferred
           CSS framework, sometimes with less than 20 lines of code.
        -  Currenty **Bootstrap-3.x** and **960.gs** are supported, but other
           CSS frameworks can be easily added in a pluggable manner.
        
        For instance, implementing the Bootstrap Carousel, required 50 lines of
        Python code and a simple Django template.

        History
        -------
        
        This project started as a simple
        `wrapper <https://github.com/jrief/cmsplugin-text-wrapper>`__ for the
        DjangoCMS TextPlugin, so that text elements could be shifted
        horizontally using the Grid System 960.
        
        DjangoCMS starting with version 3.0, allows to nest plugins inside other
        plugins. This feature made it possible to implement a `similar
        collection of
        plugins <https://github.com/jrief/djangocms-cascade/tree/bootstrap-2.3.2>`__,
        named **DjangoCMS-Bootstrap** and restricted to Twitter Bootstrap
        version 2.3.2.
        
        In **DjangoCMS-Cascade**, this limitation also has been dropped,
        enabeling it to be used for every kind of CSS framework - thus it has
        been renamed again. Additionally, the database model has been reduced
        into one single field, which now stores all kind of arbitrary data and
        to be extensible in a very flexible way.
