Description: This is a Cython-based interface to the
        `FLANN <http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN>`_ library.
        
        If you're just looking for any Python interface to FLANN, the ctypes interface
        that it ships with may be better for you. I wrote this interface for
        `an application <https://github.com/dougalsutherland/py-sdm/>`_
        that needs to run lots of independent searches without the GIL.
        
        The interface is currently incomplete; right now only float32 is supported, it
        also has some known issues, and is probably less friendly in general than it
        could be. If you want to use it, bug reports and/or pull requests are welcome.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you use the `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ Python
        distribution, the easiest way to get both cyflann and FLANN is::
        
           conda install -c http://conda.binstar.org/dougal cyflann
        
        Otherwise, you need to install FLANN yourself, and can then run::
        
           pip install cyflann
        
        If you're using FLANN 1.8.4 or earlier (the most recent release), a problem
        with its pkg-config files means that cyflann won't link properly.
        This has been fixed in the development branch since April 2013, but there
        hasn't been an official release since then.
        To work around this problem, set the environment variable ``FLANN_DIR`` to the
        root of the installation before running ``pip`` or ``setup.py``, e.g.
        ``/usr/local`` if the libraries are in ``/usr/local/lib/libflann.so``.
        
        cyflann supports FLANN's OpenMP wrappers, but has not been tested with its
        MPI or CUDA interfaces.
