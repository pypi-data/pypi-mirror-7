Mini Test
=========

This project is inspired by Ruby minispec, but now it just implement
some methods including:

::

    must_equal, must_true, must_false, must_raise.

And some other useful functions:

::

    p, pp, pl, ppl, length, size, inject, flag_test

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

install:

::

    pip install minitest

code:

::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # import the minitest
        from minitest import *

        import operator

        # declare a variable for test
        tself = get_test_self()
        # you could put all your test variables on tself
        # just like declare your variables on setup.
        tself.jc = "jc"

        # declare a test
        with test(object.must_equal):
            tself.jc.must_equal('jc')
            None.must_equal(None)


        with test(object.must_true):
            True.must_true()
            False.must_true()

        with test(object.must_false):
            True.must_false()
            False.must_false()

        # using a funcation to test equal.
        with test("object.must_equal_with_func"):
            (1).must_equal(1, key=operator.eq)
            (1).must_equal(2, key=operator.eq)

        def div_zero():
            1/0
            
        # test exception
        with test("test must_raise"):
            (lambda : div_zero()).must_raise(ZeroDivisionError)
            (lambda : div_zero()).must_raise(ZeroDivisionError, "integer division or modulo by zero")
            (lambda : div_zero()).must_raise(ZeroDivisionError, "in")

Other useful function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

p, pp, pl, ppl, length, size, these four functions could been used by
any object.

p is a print function. This function will add variable name as the
title. code:

::

    value = "Minitest"
    # add a title 'value : ' automatically.
    value.p()                       # value : Minitest

    # or you can give a string as title.
    value.p("It is a value:")       # It is a value: Minitest

    # if you don't want a title, use the parameter
    value.p(auto_get_title=False)   # Minitest

pp is another print function which will invoke the pprint.pprint
function. Its parameters are just like the p. code:

::

    value = "Minitest"
    value.pp()                      # value :
                                    # 'Minitest'
                                    
    value.pp("It is a value:")      #  It is a value:
                                    # 'Minitest'
                                    
    value.pp(auto_get_title=False)  # 'Minitest'

pl is another print function which will print the file path and line NO.
And some editors support to go to the line of that file, such as
Sublime2. Its parameters are just like the p. Notice, it will print new
line firstly, since in some case, there will be other string before file
path, which cause some editor cannot jump to the location.

code:

::

    value = "Minitest"
    value.pl()                      #     
                                    #     File "/Users/Colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 72
                                    # value : Minitest
                                    
    value.pl("It is a value:")      #     
                                    #     File "/Users/Colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 73
                                    #  It is a value: Minitest
                                    
    value.pl(auto_get_title=False)  #     
                                    #     File "/Users/Colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 74
                                    # Minitest

ppl is another print function which will print the file path and line
NO. It almost like pl except print value in another new line. Notice, it
will print new line firstly. code:

::

    value = "Minitest"
    value.ppl()                     #     
                                    #     File "/Users/Colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 76
                                    # value :
                                    # 'Minitest'
                                    
    value.ppl("It is a value:")     #     
                                    #     File "/Users/Colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 77
                                    #  It is a value:
                                    # 'Minitest'
                                    
    value.ppl(auto_get_title=False) #     
                                    #     File "/Users/Colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 78
                                    # 'Minitest'

length and size will invoke len function for the caller's object. code:

::

    [1,2].length()                  # 2, just like len([1,2])
    (1,2).size()                    # 2, just like len((1,2))

inject\_customized\_must\_method or inject function will inject the
function which you customize. Why do I make this function? Since in many
case I will use numpy array. When it comes to comparing two numpy array,
I have to use:

::

    import numpy
    numpy.array([1]).must_equal(numpy.array([1.0]), numpy.allclose)

For being convient, I use inject\_customized\_must\_method or inject
function like:

::

    import numpy
    inject(numpy.allclose, 'must_close')
    numpy.array([1]).must_close(numpy.array([1.0]))

flag\_test will print a message 'This place have codes for test!' with
the file path, file NO. code: flag\_test()

::

    # print like:
        File "/Users/colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 97, in <module>:
    This place have codes for test!    

    flag_test("for test")  # add a title

    # print like:
        File "/Users/colin/work/minitest/test.py", line 101, in <module>:
    for test: This place have codes for test!
