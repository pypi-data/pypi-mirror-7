        Introduction
        ============
        
        New features added:
        
        * add possibility to add specific JavaScript when the user is **inside error page**
          (useful for special code when on the "*Page not found*")
        * add possibility to **customize code for a site area** or a single content
        * not display JavaScript code for specific area of the site
        * choose to put you snippets in the page header or footer)
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        When installed, the basic Plone feature for handling JavaScript for statistics is hidden from the standard
        "*Site settings*" (in facts, it's moved to a new configuration panel called "*Analytics settings*") and
        new options are now available.
        
        JavaScript for web statistics support 
        -------------------------------------
        
        .. image:: https://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.analyticspanel/collective.analyticspanel-0.4.0-01.png
           :alt: Basic feature
        
        Nothing new there: this is simply the basic Plone feature about JavaScript inclusion, just moved in this
        separate panel (and you can put it in the header of the page).
        This is always the default code included when other options don't match.
        
        JavaScript to be included when an error message is get 
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        .. image:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.analyticspanel/collective.analyticspanel-0.4.0-02.png
           :alt: Code for error page
        
        When this product is installed you can control JavaScript code based on error messages (ignoring the default one).
        The main motivation is to use this for the ``NotFound`` (HTTP 404) error.
        
        However this feature is still generic... you could probably use it for other error code (like ``ValueError``)
        if this make any sense for you!
        
        JavaScript to be included inside specific site's paths 
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        .. image:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.analyticspanel/collective.analyticspanel-0.4.0-03.png
           :alt: Code for specific site's path
        
        You can use this section for putting a list of absolute site subsection you want to control, adding a specific
        JavaScript section and ignoring the default one.
        
        When more than a provided path match the current URL, the most specific ones is used.
        
        This kind of rule has a policy selection.
        
        .. image:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.analyticspanel/collective.analyticspanel-0.3.0-04.png
           :align: right
           :alt: Policy selection
        
        * The default one ("*to the whole subtree*") is for applying the rule to the whole subtree.
        * Using "*only to the context*" you can choose to apply the analytics code only to the content and not
          to sub-contents inside it.
        * Using "*to the context and non-folderish children*" you are applying the analytics code only to the content,
          and to all sub-contents inside it that are not folders.
        
        This last policy seems a little complex, but there are analytics tools (at least: `Piwik`__) where this can
        be useful to define custom reports for sections of the site.
        
        __ http://piwik.org/
        
        As the concept of "folder" in Plone can change with different add-ons installed, this last policy take care
        of using as "folder" what is defined in the "*Folderish types*" configuration option.

           :alt: Folderish types selection panel
        
        The Plone native "Folder" type is selected by default.
        
        Hiding
        ------
        
        You can also use this product for hiding analytics code from specific site areas or error pages, leaving a default
        one for the rest of the site.
        
        Just configure options with empty code!
        
        JavaScript in the header or footer of the page?
        ===============================================
        
        Historically Plone put analytics code in the page footer; this is an old way to go and modern analytics
        software suggest to put you code before the ``body`` tag.
        However old analytics software that can block the page rendering are better to be kept at the end of the page.
        
        For this reason this product will let you add analytics on both header or footer of the page at your choice.
        
        As you seen this option is available everywhere, for every feature added, just note that analytics in the header
        or footer are treat separately.
        
        Dependencies
        ============

        It's based on `plone.app.registry`__ that it not part of Plone on 3.3 version. You need to be sure that a compatible
