osx-openconnect-helper

  This program is a tiny helper application to connect to different
  Cisco VPNs through openconnect on OS X.  It just wraps openconnect
  to add some basic profile support.

  How to make it run on OS X:

    $ brew install openconnect
    $ brew install tuntap

  For tuntap follow the guides after installation and don't forget to
  load the kext.

  If you do not have vpnc-script you can download it:

    http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/vpnc-script.html

  To install place it in /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script and make sure it
  is executable.

  To install osx-openconnect-helper use pip or pipsi:

    $ pipsi install osx-openconnect-helper

  From that point onwards you can add a vpn:

    $ openconnect-helper add myvpn https://myvpn.invalid/ --user me

  And connect:

    $ sudo openconnect-helper connect myvpn

  It uses the OS X keychain to manage passwords.
