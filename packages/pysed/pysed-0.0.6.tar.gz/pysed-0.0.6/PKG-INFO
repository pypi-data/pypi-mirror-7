        	Python is a widely used general-purpose, HIGH LEVEL programming language. Its
                design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express
                concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. The
                language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large
                scale.
