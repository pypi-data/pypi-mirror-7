Description: pesky-settings
        ==============
        
        pesky-settings is a library for managing application settings, merging data
        from configuration files and command line arguments and converting to python
        native data types.  Additionally, pesky-settings has an 'action' interface
        which is useful for constructing hierarchical command sets.
        
        pesky-settings is built on top of the venerable getopt and ConfigParser
        packages from the python standard library, so it should work on any python
        you can find (as opposed to optparse or argparse packages, which were
        somewhat late additions to python 2).
