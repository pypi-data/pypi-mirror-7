        Introduction
        ============
        
        Scope of this product is to make possible an expand/collapse feature in Plone navigation(s)
        portlet without any modification to the navigation code itself, or any needs to override its features.
        
        This product *is not* a new navigation portlet, is just a JavaScript add-on that rely on native Plone's
        `jQuery`__ support.
        
        __ http://jquery.com/
        
        More important: it is only focused to make *some* navigation links to be expandable. 
        
        When you will like this?
        ------------------------
        
        The collective.navigationtoggle is useful when your Plone site needs (not much) special handling of
        navigation elements. Sometimes your site structure is someway like this::
        
            ROOT
            |
            |_ FolderWhatever
            \_ NotImportantFolder
               |
               |_ ImportantFolder1
               ...
               \_ ImportantFolderN
        
        If you configure your navigation portlet on the site root, users must click on the *NotImportantFolder*
        and reload the whole page to reach the *ImportantFolder*'s section.
        The site at the *NotImportantFolder* level is not useful... maybe you only give a *folder_listing* view
        or a default page that only say "Welcome to an important area of the site, please visit the subsection
        you are looking for...".
        
        For the user experience the first click is only a waste of time.
        
        What you are looking for can be a client side effect that expand/collapse the folder in the navigation.
        The *NotImportantFolder* itself is not seen as a real content in your information architecture.
        
        What will change
        ----------------

           :target: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.navigationtoggle/collective.navigationtoggle-0.3.0-02.png
        
        Make possible that special navigation links will no more move the user to the target section but simply
        shows in the navigation itself all subsections (so the navigation seems like the user really moved to
        the target folder).
        
        A second click will collapse the section.
        
        Default page in a folder, elements marked with "*Exclude from navigation*" and unwanted
        type from the ``metaTypesNotToList`` property will be excluded.
        
        The script try to simulate best at possible a normal portlet navigation behaviour.
        
        The code keeps in mind *graceful degradation*. Browser without JavaScript enabled will simply use basic
        Plone navigation features.
        
        Detailed documentation
        ======================
        
        Basic configuration
        -------------------
        
        In your Plone configuration panel you'll find the new "*Navigation Toggle settings*".
        
        .. image:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.navigationtoggle/collective.navigationtoggle-0.4.0-01.png/image_preview
           :alt: Setup of Navigation Toggle configuration
           :target: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.navigationtoggle/collective.navigationtoggle-0.4.0-01.png
        
        
        From this section you can configure a lot of advanced options, mainly you need to configure:
        
        **Link selectors**
            A set of URL path suffix like ``/foo1/foo2`` of an *href* attribute for a link.
            With this example a link like this will be *hit*::
            
                <a href="http://plonehost/plone/foo1/foo2">
            
            Commonly only link inside navigation portlet are checked (see the "*Toggle container classes*").
            
            You can also provide here a complex jQuery expression, for example::
            
                li.navTreeItem a
            
            If you don't directly provide a selector that match an HTML <A> element, you still need to query for something
            *inside* that kind of node, for example::
            
                li.navTreeItem a.contenttype-folder span
            
            In the last example above, only a click of the navigation entry text will trigger the expand/collapse features,
            while clicking on the icon will keep the default browser behavior.
        
        **Animation delay**
            The product can enable for you a graphical effect when you expand/collapse items. This is disabled by
            default.
        
            To enable it you must change this value to something higher that 0. The value you put there is the time
            (in millisec) used for the `slideDown`__ and `slideUp`__ jQuery's effect.
        
            __ http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
            __ http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
        
            Simply put it to 0 again (the default) to disable effect.
        
        Advanced configurations
        -----------------------
        
        **Cache**
            Check it to perform client side cache of the AJAX request.
            If disabled a request to the server will be performed for every click on navigations.
        
        **Toggle container classes**
            A set of CSS classes that mark you navigation elements.
            Only links inside elements with one of those classes are "toggleable".
            
            Note that this option is ignored for "Links selectors" entries where you used a jQuery
            expression and not a URL path.
        
        **HTML list type**
            The type of HTML container element to looks for.
        
        **HTML list item**
            The type of HTML item element to be generated.
        
        Styles
        ------
        
        This products dinamically adds two new possible CSS classes to ``<li>`` elements that contains links that match
        the configuration.
        
        Class "*cnavClosed*" is added when a special navigation elements is shown on the page and when you close
        a subtree.
        When a subsection is open, the class "*cnavOpen*" is added to the same element.
        
        The generated substructure is a copy of the main structure given by Plone, but a "*cnavGenerated*" class is
        added to it.
        
        You can (but this product doesn't) rely on those classes to give additional styles effects in your
        Plone theme.
        
        Not standard navigation (...or portlet... or whatever you want)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This products *may* also works on non-standard navigation HTML structure (as the generations on subelement
        is done cloning existings node from the same navigation portlet) but some assumptions are done.
        
        As the code works almost client side, you can also use it in portlets that are not standard navigation.
        Theoretically you can use it with something that is not even a portlet!

        Cache controls
        ==============
        
        Toggle configuration are stored in a JavaScript file that your browser and Plone *portal_javascript* tool
        will probably cache.
        
        When changing configuration you can use the "*Save and invalidate JS cache*" button.
