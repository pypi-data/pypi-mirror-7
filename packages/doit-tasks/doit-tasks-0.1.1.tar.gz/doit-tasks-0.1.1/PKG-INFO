Description: DoIt
        ===
        
        A stupid simple CLI task manager, in Python!
        
        Huh?
        ----
        
        DoIt lets you store your tasks in a handy CLI.
        
        For example:
        
            $ doit "Fix grandma's internet"
            Got it! You need to fix grandma's internet.
            
            $ doit
            Here's what you still need to do:
            (0): Fix grandma's internet
