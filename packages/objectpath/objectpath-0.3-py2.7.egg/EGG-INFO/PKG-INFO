Description: ObjectPath
        ==========
        
        The agile NoSQL query language for semi-structured data
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        **#Python #Javascript #JSON #XML #nested-array-object**
        
        ObjectPath is a query language similar to XPath or JSONPath, but much
        more powerful thanks to embedded arithmetic calculations, comparison
        mechanisms and built-in functions. This makes the language more like SQL
        in terms of expressiveness, but it works over JSON documents rather than
        relations. ObjectPath can be considered a full-featured expression
        language. Besides selector mechanism there is also boolean logic, type
        system and string concatenation available. On top of that, the language
        implementations (Python at the moment; Javascript is in beta!) are
        secure and relatively fast.

        ObjectPath makes it easy to find data in big nested JSON documents. It
        borrows the best parts from E4X, JSONPath, XPath and SQL. ObjectPath is
        to JSON documents what XPath is to XML. Other examples to ilustrate this
        kind of relationship are:
        
        \| Scope \| Language \| \|---\|---\| \| text documents \| regular
        expression \| \| XML \| XPath \| \| HTML \| CSS selectors \| \| JSON
        documents \| ObjectPath \|

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        `ObjectPath
        Reference <http://docs.asyncode.com/text/ObjectPath-reference>`_
        
        What's in this repo?
        --------------------
        
        ObjectPathPY - Python implementation of ObjectPath. This is a stable
        piece of code extracted from `AC
        Runtime <http://github.com/adriank/ACR>`_ used in production for over
        one year without problems. While ObjectPath paths are working perfectly
        (all tests are passed), integration with Python programs is not
        documented. Use ObjectPath.py file as a reference of usage. Also
        Python-specific topics such as generators, chains and optimizations are
        not documented (comming soon!).
        
        ObjectPathJS - beta version of Javascript implementation. Many tests
        passed, {} and functions are not implemented yet. Javascript
        implementation has the very same API as the Python version.
        
        Command line usage
        ------------------
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/adriank/ObjectPath.git
            cd ObjectPath/ObjectPathPy
            python ObjectPath -o file.json
        
        Python PIP usage
        ----------------
        
        ::
        
            $ sudo pip install objectpath
            $ python
            >>> from objectpath import *
            >>> tree=Tree({"a":1})
            >>> tree.execute("$.a")
            1
            >>>
