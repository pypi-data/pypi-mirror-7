This module provides Python helper routines for using multiple GoPro, 
Flip, DSLR, etc cameras to obtain calibrations and get 3D reconstructions
of things like animal position. 

nb: Argus had like a thousand eyes or something. This will certainly work
for 3 cameras but we haven't tried a thousand.
