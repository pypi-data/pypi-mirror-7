LightWriter
===========

Lightwriter is a combination of an Ardunio sketch and some Python classes for controlling a
RadioShack Tricolor LED strip (http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=22128606).
Much of the code is borrowed from the RadioShack source (at http://blog.radioshack.com/2013/06/tricolor-led-strip/)
as well as some community adjustments (http://pastebin.com/eEB61uWV).

Originally, this project was written to create a Rasberry Pi and Arduino device for displaying
Nagios alerts.  However, this code could be easily re-applied for a lot of more fun use cases.
