Check out `Object Hunter`_, a ``pyparty`` script for identifying, summarizing and plotting 
groups of objects in an image.

pyparty: Python (py) particles (party) 
======================================

``pyparty`` is a small library for drawing, labeling, patterning and manipulating 
particles in 2d images.  ``pyparty`` was built primarily over the excellent
image processing library, scikit-image_.

Overview and Features
=====================

``pyparty`` provides a simple API for particle analysis in 2d images, while streamlining 
common operations in the image processing pipeline.  

*Some key features include*:

1. Pythonic **ParticleManager** for storing and manipulating particles from image 
   labels OR builtin shapes.  Some highlights of **Particles** include:
       - A common datastructure for array operations like rotations and 
         translations.
       - ``skimage`` descriptors_ as primary attributes on all particles.
       - Filtering and mapping based with numpy logical indexing syntax. 
         
2. A **Grid** system for patterning particles, as well as mesh utilities for creating 
   image backgrounds.

3. A **Canvas** to easily integrate *Grids*, *Particles* and flexible *Backgrounds*. 
   In addition, Canvas also provides simplified interfaces for:
      - binarization / thresholding
      - plotting
      - slicing and other pythonic container operations

4. A plotting API based on matplotlib.imshow() that generally supports 
    rasterizaztions AND `matplotlib patches`_.

5. Flexible color designations ('red', (1,0,0), 00FF00), and strict typing
   to ensure consistency in data and plots.

6. General ndarray operations such as rotations and translations supported by ALL particle types.

7. API for adding **Noise** to images.

   .. _descriptors : http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops
   .. _`matplotlib patches` : http://matplotlib.org/examples/api/patch_collection.html

What are some use cases, and will pyparty help to me?
=====================================================

Tasked well-suited for ``pyparty`` include:

1. Filtering and characterization of cells based on descriptors like
eccentricit and area.

2. Patterning a grid of particles over a shadowed background to compare performance
   of thresholding algorithms.

3. Manipulating particles in a *pythonic* manner:

   - delete all particles that have area > 50 pixels.
   - sort and color ellipses in order of increasing eccentricity.
   - dilate all particles appearing in bottom half of an image

4. Scripting without leaving Python.

5. Plot particles as rasterizations or matplotlib patches side-by-side.

In short, you may consider using ``pyparty`` if you are doing image analysis and find 
generating, managing or labeling particles as a bottleneck.

History
=======
``pyparty`` originally began at the George Washington University (2013) in an 
effort to generate test data for SEM and AFM images of gold nanoparticles on glass substrates.
We really enjoyed scikit-image_ for image processing and sought to implement it in generating test data.  
We sought to provide an API for managing labeled particles from real images.  Scikit-image draw and measure
modules laid the groundwork to the core functionality that ``pyparty`` attempts to streamline. 

I should also note that some of the inspiration came from the excellent ``Analyze Particles`` features
in ImageJ_.

License
=======

3-Clause Revised BSD_

   .. _BSD : https://github.com/hugadams/pyparty/blob/master/LICENSE.txt

Dependencies
============
``pyparty`` requires ``scikit-image``, ``Traits`` and their dependencies, which
include many core packages such as ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib``.  If you are new
to Python for scientific computing, consider downloading a packaged distribution_.

   .. _distribution :  https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/

``pyparty`` uses Traits_ because it is well-suited for writing clean, type-checked
object-oriented classes. You will not need to understand or use ``Traits``
unless you develop for ``pyparty``; *it is not used in the public API*, and may be 
removed in future installments after the core functionality is stable.

   .. _Traits : http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/
   
Installation
============

I would recommend using `Enthought Canopy`_ and installing ``Traits`` and 
``scikit-image`` through the package manager; however, ``pyparty`` is also 
registered on PyPi_.

   .. _PyPi : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyparty

Pip Install
-----------

Make sure you have pip installed:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    
Then:
   
    pip install pyparty
    
To install all of the dependencies, download ``pyparty`` from github, navigate
to the base directory and type:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Installation from source
------------------------

In the ``pyparty`` base directory run:

    python setup.py install

The developmental version can be cloned from github:

    git clone https://github.com/hugadams/pyparty.git
    
This will not install any dependencies.

About the Author
================

I'm a PhD student at GWU (check me out on researchgate_, Linkedin_ or twitter_)
and former Enthought intern. I work in biomolecule sensing and plasmonics.  
Like any PhD student, my time is stretched across many projects.  As such,
the ``pyparty`` source code may is messy in places, and a proper nosetests
platform is still under development.  Batch running the IPython notebook tutorials 
serves as a basic regression test platform.
