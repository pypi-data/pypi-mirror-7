js.url_parser
*************

Introduction
============

This library packages `url-parser`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`url-parser`: https://github.com/MadeByMike/url-parser

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.url_parser``) are published to some URL.
