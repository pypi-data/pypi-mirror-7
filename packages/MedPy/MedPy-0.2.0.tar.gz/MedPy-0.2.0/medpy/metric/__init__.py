@package medpy.metric
Metric measures.

Provides a number of metric measures that e.g. can be used for testing and/or evaluation
purposes on two binary masks (i.e. measuring their similarity) or distance between
histograms.

Modules:
    - histogram: Holds a number of real or near histogram distance metrics.
    - image: Metrics computed directly on the image intensities.
    - binary: Metrics to compare binary objects in images.
