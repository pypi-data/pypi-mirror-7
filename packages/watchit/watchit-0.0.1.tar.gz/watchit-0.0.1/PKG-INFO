        Using
        =======
        
        
        A typical use of the this is to wait a second after a file has changed and then
        run `make`. Put that all in a loop.::
        
            while true; do watchit && sleep 1 && make; done
        
        Issues
        ========
        
        It stops when doing a `ctrl-c` but doesn't exit.  The workaround right now is
        to use `ctrl-z` and then `kill %1`.
