Description: ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Once in a lifetime of a computer user is the need to rename multiple folders or files. Normally, the user will try to find all the locations of the folders or files to be renamed one by one starting from a starting folder (i.e. target folder). Some sample use cases that multiple renaming is done by the user are the following:
        
        * Copied a bunch of template folders and files and then renamed them accordingly.
        * Downloaded a bunch of episode of a TV series and the user has his/her own file naming convention.
        * A java developer is duplicating a big working package where the source files have embedded acronyms where he needs to rename those with a new the acronym. 
        
        Without a simple tool, these use cases are very time consuming to accomplish. This is the motivation that made this simple **Name Modifier** project to exist.
        
        ===========
        The Package
        ===========
        
        Name Modifier has three packages for different OS:
        
        ============================= ===============================================================================================
        Package                       Description
        ============================= ===============================================================================================
        namemod-<version>.zip         Contains the Python source codes and documents packaged for Windows and Python 3.4 is required.
        namemod-<version>.tar.gz      Contains the Python source codes and documents packaged for Linux and Python 3.4 is required.
        namemod-<version>.win-bin.zip Contains binary for Windows which doesnâ€™t need Python to be installed
        ============================= ===============================================================================================
        
        These packages are normally downloadable in addresses below:
        
          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/namemod
        
        and
        
          https://sourceforge.net/projects/namemodifier/files
        
        If the user had Python 3.4 installed, he/she doesnâ€™t necessary needs to download this binary. The user can just use the pip module (see 
        Installing the module using pip) for installation.
        
        ==================================
        Installing the Package for Windows
        ==================================
        
        The installation is as easy as downloading the namemod-<version>.win-bin.zip package and extracting it to wherever directory the user needs it to be. Moreover, it is recommended to include the installation directory to the users **PATH environment variable**. 
        
        ===============================
        Installing the module using pip
        ===============================
        
        If the user had Python 3.4 installed, he/she can just use the pip module by running the command in Command 1.
        
        **Command 1. Using pip module for installation**
        ::
        
          C:\>python -m pip install namemod
        
        =========================
        Using the namemod command
        =========================
        
        Name Modifier can be used as easy as the other command line (e.g. dir) known to the user. The main command in this package is **namemod**. This command has many arguments that the user can opt to. 
        If the user opted to install namemod using pip module (see Installing the module using pip), all the commands in the following sections can be carried out by using python with the following format found in Command 2:
        
        **Command 2. Using namemod with python**
        ::
        
          python -m namemod [optional arguments] <folder> <old_name_segment> <new_name_segment>
        
        The -h or --help argument
        -------------------------
        
        Normally the first thing to do is to know how to use the command. This can be accomplished quickly by the -h or --help argument. For example, execute the command found in Command 3. 
        
        **Command 3. Using -h argument**
        ::
        
          python -m namemod â€“h
