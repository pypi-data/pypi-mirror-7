Description: Introduction
        
        Once in a lifetime of a computer user is the need to rename multiple folders or files. Normally, the user will try to find all the locations of the folders or files to be renamed one by one starting from a starting folder (i.e. target folder). Some sample use cases that multiple renaming is done by the user are the following:
        * Copied a bunch of template folders and files and then renamed them accordingly.
        * Downloaded a bunch of episode of a TV series and the user has his/her own file naming convention.
        * A java developer is duplicating a big working package where the source files have embedded acronyms where he needs to rename those with a new the acronym. 
        Without a simple tool, these use cases are very time consuming to accomplish. This is the motivation that made this simple Name Modifier project to exist.
        
        Installing the Package
        
        The installation is as easy as downloading the package and extracting it to wherever directory the user needs it to be. Moreover, it is recommended to include the installation directory to the users PATH environment variable. 
        
        Where to report any issues or improvements?
        
        The user can create a ticket for any issues discovered or wish for improvements to the https://sourceforge.net/p/namemodifier/tickets/?source=navbar address.
