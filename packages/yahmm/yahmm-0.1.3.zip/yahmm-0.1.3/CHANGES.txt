v0.1.0, 4/28/2014 -- Initial commit

v0.1.1, 4/28/2014 -- Documentation and examples provided

v0.1.2, 5/5/2014 -- Changed instances of dtype=numpy.int to 
	dtype=numpy.int32, as other int types are not properly 
	recognized as integers on Unix machines, but as shorts or longs.
v0.1.3, 5/8/2014 -- Added optional removal of orphan states and chains
	in the bake method. Added two underflow protections: row
	normalization in the forward/backward algorithms, and a better
	logsumexp function. Fixed writing and reading so that the
	original distributions work. Still need to fix the functions
	under InverseGamma. Added more documentation.
