Description: 
            Filtered WebSocket is a straight forward framework for implementing websocket servers which draws inspiration from UNIX process pipelines.
            It's a metaphor for: cat server_event | behavior_a | behavior_b | ...
            Server event handlers are encapsulated within filters such that building elaborate behaviors is as easy as importing new modules.
            Imported filters automatically add themselves to an appropriate filter chain (pipeline).
        
            - Supports SSL
            - Scales horizontally via remote backend storage (redis) and pubsub
              handling
            - Supports token based auth
            - New behaviors are added by simply importing filter modules
