SKA is a pure Python implementation of Blowfish and AES
with EBC, CBC and PCBC modes and variable key length support.

The project is a fork of Alexey V Michurin's project available on google-code
SKA project homepage: http://code.google.com/p/ska/

I have forked this and changed the package name so that it can be available for install through pip
