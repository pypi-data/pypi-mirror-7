- Includes PAL v0.5.0

- Now ships with ERFA v1.1 rather than SOFA. This clarifies
  the license of the included code.

- New interfaces added for refraction and moving sources. The new
  functions are: epv, evp, el2ue, pertel, pertue, planel, planet,
  plante, plantu, pv2el, pv2ue, rdplan, ue2el, ue2pv, atmdsp,
  refcoq, refro, refv, aopqk, prenut, prenut, refco and refz.
  Thanks to Scott Daniel for adding the final four in that list.
