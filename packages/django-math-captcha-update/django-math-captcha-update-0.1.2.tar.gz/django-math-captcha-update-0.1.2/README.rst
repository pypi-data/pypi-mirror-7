Note: this includes an update to a deprecated import in the util.py file in order to make this Django 1.6+ compatible.

Django Math Captcha is an easy way to add mathematical captcha verification to your already existing forms.
It asks you a simple math question (eg ``'1 + 2 ='``) and validates the form if your response is correct.
All you have to do is subclass either ``MathCaptchaForm`` or ``MathCaptchaModelForm`` in your own forms.

Extending your forms::

    from math_captcha import MathCaptchaModelForm
    from myapp.forms import BlogForm

    class MyExistingForm(BlogForm,MathCaptchaModelForm): # instead of forms.ModelForm
        #... extra fields here
            

Now you can be certain that the only users who create blogs are humans.

Using with other apps
----------------------

If you are running an app like, say `django-contact-form`_ and want to add math captcha here is how to go about it.

Add the following in your ``urls.py``::

    from contact_form.forms import ContactForm
    from math_captcha.forms import MathCaptchaForm
    
    class CaptchaContactForm(ContactForm,MathCaptchaForm):
        pass
        
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^contact/$','contact_form.views.contact_form',{'form_class':CaptchaContactForm},name='contact_form'),
        url(r'^contact/sent/$','django.views.generic.simple.direct_to_template',{ 'template': 'contact_form/contact_form_sent.html' },name='contact_form_sent'),
        ...
    )
    
Now the contact form will block robots who cant do math.
