How To Install Mahotas
======================

From source
-----------

You can get the released version using your favorite Python package manager::

If you prefer, you can download the source from `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mahotas>`__ and run::

    python setup.py install

You will need to have ``numpy`` and a ``C++`` compiler.
