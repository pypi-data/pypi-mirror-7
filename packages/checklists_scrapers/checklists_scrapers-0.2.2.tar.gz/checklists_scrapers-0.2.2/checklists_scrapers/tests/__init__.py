"""Project tests.

Two categories of tests are available:

    spiders - unit test verifying the basic operation of the scrapers and the
    parsers they use to extract data,

    validation - integration tests that use the programs in the scripts
    directory to download and extract data from third-party sites to verify
    the correct behaviour of the scrapers. These tests are also useful to
    check for changes to the sites that require the scrapers to be updated.
