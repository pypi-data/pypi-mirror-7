Version 0.2.3
-------------

  * Added request to WorldBirds parser to select 'English' as the language
    to display pages in. The account preferences do have a option to select
    language but this is not apparently used.

  * Fixed the extraction of checklist attributes, location, protocol, etc. to
    use the labels from the table where the values are displayed rather than
    relying on fixed row indices since the size of the table changes (more
    than it used to?).

Version 0.2.2
-------------

  * Fixed error when parsing lists of observers from the checklists web
    page on eBird.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

  * Locked down version numbers for packages.

Version 0.2
-----------

  * Cleaned up organisation of docs source files.

  * Removed CHECKLISTS_ prefix from settings and package constants.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

  * Updated the ebird scraper so the breakdown of a count by age and sex
    extracted from the checklist web page has an identifier with the form
    DET<id> where <id> is a two-digit integer created from the index of
    the cell in the table.

  * Checklists are now saved in JSON format with an indent of 4 to make them
    easier to read (and debug).

Version 0.1
-----------

  * Renamed the constant used to identify the version number of the downloaded
    checklists from CHECKLIST_FILE_FORMAT_VERSION to CHECKLISTS_DOWNLOAD_FORMAT.
    Similarly renamed CHECKLIST_FILE_LANGUAGE to CHECKLISTS_DOWNLOAD_LANGUAGE.
  * Renamed the project and the main module to checklists_scrapers. The
    project is part of a group designed to work with the django-checklists
    database and the association is clearer with the change in name.
  * Changed the licence from GPLv3 to BSD so it is compatible with the other
    projects in the checklists "group".
  * Changes the prefix used on the environment variables from "CHECKLISTING"
    to "CHECKLISTS" to minimise the number that must be set when used the
    scrapers with the django-checklists app.
  * Added scripts to run the site tests for each scraper. This makes it
    easier to pass in the parameters for the site to be scraped rather than
    defining them in the settings.
  * Configuring the scrapers is now done through environment variables rather
    than a local settings file. This makes it much easier to install and run
    the scrapers, particularly from the most common use-case of calling them
    from cron or a similar scheduler.
  * Removed the scrapy project file since the settings file will typically be
    set using an environment variable.
  * Fixed the version of scrapy to use, to 0.16.4 for now, since there are
    (distracting), deprecated calls when using the latest version (0.20.2).
  * Updated the logging so records found only on the web page for an eBird
    checklist are only reported as warnings when the logging level is set to
    DEBUG. This avoids any confusion in production since the warnings are only
    used to debug issues with the eBird API.
  * The status report is now written to the directory where checklists are
    downloaded when the logging level is set to 'DEBUG'.
  * Fixed bugs caused by unexpected missing fields when downloading checklists
    from eBird.

Version 0.1b2
-------------

  * Fixed docs structure so it can be built by readthedocs.org.

Version 0.1b1
-------------

  * Added sphinx for document generation.
  * Updated documentation, improving the README and adding longer descriptions
    in the main documentation, also hosted on readthedocs.org.

Version 0.1a5
-------------

  * Corrected errors in reStructuredText formatting.
  * Updates install instructions to make them more readable.

Version 0.1a4
-------------

  * Replaced separate settings for the directory to download checklist to by
    a single setting, CHECKLISTING_DOWNLOADS_DIR that is used by all spiders.
  * Added a meta dictionary attribute with the keys 'version' and 'language'
    to the JSON format files containing the downloaded checklist.
  * Checklist files now contain ints and floats for numbers and coordinates.
  * Protocols are defined using a name rather than a pre-defined code. Same for
    the codes used in the 'details' section of the checklist entries . This
    avoids making assumptions on where and how the data will be loaded.
  * Species records now contain only two fields: name and scientific_name.
  * Removed the language suffix from comment fields. The language for comments
    is given in the 'meta' attribute.
  * Added tests to download and validate checklists from real sites.
  * Added an activity field to the checklist.
  * Source and observers are now nested dictionaries.

Version 0.1a3
-------------

  * Login failures on the WorldBirds spider now raises a LoginException.
  * Added an extension to record spider errors. Updated the status report to
    include errors.
  * Added a status report which is generated and emailed when a spider closes.
  * Added support for local_settings.py to override scrapy settings.
  * Added a spider for downloading checklists for WorldBirds.

Version 0.1a2
-------------

  * Fixed the problem of checklists getting assigned to the wrong response by
    limiting the number of simultaneous requests.
  * Simplified the arguments used to initialize the eBird spider by moving
    semi-static ones into the settings file.

Version 0.1a1
-------------

  * Initial version with working spider downloading checklists from eBird.
