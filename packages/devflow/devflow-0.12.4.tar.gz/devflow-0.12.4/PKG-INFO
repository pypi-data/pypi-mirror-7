        Overview
        --------
        
        devflow is a set of Python tools to manage versions, help implement the git
        flow development process, and build Python and Debian packages. Although it has
        been developed primarily for use with Synnefo, other projects may find it
        useful too.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        ```
        import os
        
        from devflow.version import get_python_version
        os.environ["DEVFLOW_BUILD_MODE"] = "snapshot"
        print "This commit's Python version is", get_python_version()
        ```
        
        or take a look at devflow's own setup.py for ideas.
