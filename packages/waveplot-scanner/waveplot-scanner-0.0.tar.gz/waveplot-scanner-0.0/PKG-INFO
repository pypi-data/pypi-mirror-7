Description: WavePlot is a system for storing data about audio
            files. Audio files can be scanned using this python script on any system
            with libwaveplot installed, and the generated WavePlots will be uploaded
            to a central server at http://waveplot.net for public viewing.
        
            In the future, this package may be renamed and additional functionality
            included, such as matching previously untagged files and tagging those
            files with metadata.
        
            This script is mainly intended to demonstrate how other applications might
            use the libwaveplot library to make use of the WavePlot system themselves.
