        This little package applies the law of sines or cosines to find all the
        sides and angles of a triangle, if you know some of the sides and/or
        angles.
        
        The main function defined by this package is solve(...). Simple example::
        
            from math import pi
            from trianglesolver import solve
            a,b,c,A,B,C = solve(b=7.6, c=8.3, A=pi/3)
        
        Following the usual convention, lower-case letters are side lengths and
        capital letters are angles. Corresponding letters are opposite each other,
        e.g. side b is opposite angle B.
        
        All angles are in radians! However, you can use the degree constant to
        convert::
        
            from trianglesolver import solve, degree
            a,b,c,A,B,C = solve(b=7, A=5*degree, B=70*degree)
            print(C / degree)
