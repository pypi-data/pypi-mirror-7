Description: mongodog
        ========
        
        A python library, that helps you sniff out your own code that is running on mongo (using pymongo or mongokit).
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        Mongo has profile functionality and it is great. Why do we need mongodog? Well, mongodog includes one very important
        feature that mongo profile doesn't - python traceback of the calling code. Sometimes you just need to know where the
        command is coming from.
