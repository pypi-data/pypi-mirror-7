django-adv-cache-tag
====================

Django advanced cache template tag:

-  versioning
-  compress
-  partial caching
-  easily extendable/customizable

Readable documentation on http://documentup.com/twidi/django-adv-cache-tag

Introduction
------------

First, notice that the arguments of the ``{% cache %}`` templatetag
provided by ``django-adv-cache-tag`` are the same as for the default
cache templatetag included in django, so it's very easy to use this new
one.

With ``django-adv-cache-tag`` you can :

-  add a version number (int, string, date or whatever, it will be
   stringified) to you templatetag : the version will be compared to the
   cached one, and the exact same cache key will be used for the new
   cached template, avoiding keeping old unused keys in your cache,
   allowing you to cache forever.
-  avoid to be afraid of an incompatible update in our algorithm,
   because we also use an internal version number, updated only when the
   internal algorithm changes
-  define your own cache keys (or more simple, just add the primary key
   (or what you want, it's a templatetag parameter) to this cache key
-  compress the data to be cached, to reduce memory consumption in your
   cache backend, and network latency (but it will use more time and cpu
   to compress/decompress)
-  choose which cache backend will be used
-  define ``{% nocache %}...{% endnocache %}`` blocks, inside your
   cached template, that will only be rendered when asked (for these
   parts, the content of the template is cached, not the rendered
   result)
-  easily define your own algorithm, as we provide a single class you
   can inherit from, and simply change options or whatever behaviour you
   want, and define your own tags for them

Installation
------------

``django-adv-cache-tag`` is available on Pypi:

::

    pip install django-adv-cache-tag

Or you can find it on github:
https://github.com/twidi/django-adv-cache-tag

When installed, just add ``adv_cache_tag`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in
the ``settings.py`` file of your django project.

See examples in the next section to see how it works (basically the same
way as the default django cache templatetag)

Features
--------

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

With the default django cache templatetag, you can add as many arguments
you want, including a version, or date, and then the cache key will
change if this version change. So your cache is updated, as you wanted.

But the older key is not deleted and it you have a long expire time, it
will stay there for a very long time, consuming your precious memory.

``django-adv-cache-tag`` provide a way to avoid this, while still
regenerate the cache when needed. For this, when activated, we use the
last arguments passed to your templatetag as a "version number", and
remove it for the arguments used to generate the cache key.

This version will be used in the **content** of the cached template,
instead of the **key**, and when the cache exists and is loaded, the
cached version will be compared to the wanted one, and if the two match,
the cache is valid and returned, else it will be regenerated.

So if you like the principle of a unique key for a given template for a
given object/user or whatever, be sure to always use the same arguments,
except the last one, and activate the ``ADV_CACHE_VERSIONING``.

Note that we also manage an internal version number, which will always
be compared to the cached one. This internal version number is only
updated when the internal algorithm of ``django-adv-cache-tag`` changes.
But you can update it to invalidate all cached templates by adding a
``ADV_CACHE_VERSION`` to your settings (our internel version and the
value from this settings will be concatenated to obtain the real used
internal version)

Settings
^^^^^^^^

``ADV_CACHE_VERSIONING``, default to ``False`` ``ADV_CACHE_VERSION``,
default to ``""``

Example
^^^^^^^

In the following template, if ``ADV_CACHE_VERSIONING`` set to True, the
key will always be the same, based on the string "myobj\_main\_template"
and the value of ``obj.pk``, but the cached value will be regenerated
each time the ``obj.date_last_updated`` will change.

So we set a ``expire_time`` of ``0``, to always keep the template
cached, because we now we won't have many copies (old ones and current
one) of it.

.. code:: django

    {% load adv_cache %}
    {% cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_updated %}
      {{ obj }}
    {% endcache %}

Primary key
~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

In the default django cache templatetag, the cache keys are like this
one :

::

    :1:template.cache.your_fragment_name.64223ccf70bbb65a3a4aceac37e21016

You may want to have more explicit cache keys, so with
``django-adv-cache-tag`` you can add a "primary key" that will be added
between the fragment name and the hash :

::

    :1:template.cache.your_fragment_name.you_pk.64223ccf70bbb65a3a4aceac37e21016

Although the main use of this primary key is to have one cached fragment
per object, so we can use the objet primary key, you can use whatever
you want, an id, a string...

To add a primary key, simply set the ``ADV_CACHE_INCLUDE_PK`` settings
to ``True``, and the first arguments (after the fragment's name) will be
used as a pk.

If you want this only for a part of your cache templatetags, read the
``Extending the default cache tag`` part later in this readme.

Unlike the version, the primary key will be kept as an argument to
generate the cache key hash.

Settings
^^^^^^^^

``ADV_CACHE_INCLUDE_PK``, default to ``False``

Example
^^^^^^^

A common use of ``django-adv-cache-tag`` is to only use a primary key
and a version:

.. code:: django

    {% cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_updated %}

Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The default django cache templatetag simply save the generated html in
the cache. Depending of your template, if may be a lot of html and your
cache memory will grow very quickly. Not to mention that we can have a
lot of spaces because of indentation in templates (two ways i know to
remove them without ``django-adv-cache-tag``: the ``{% spaceless %}``
templatetag, provided by django, and
`django-template-preprocessor <https://github.com/citylive/django-template-preprocessor/>`__).

``django-adv-cache-tag`` can do this for you. It is able to remove
duplicate spaces (including newlines, tabs) by replacing them by a
simple space (to keep the space behavior in html), and to compress the
html to be cached, via the ``zlib`` (and ``pickle``) module.

Of course, this cost some time and CPU cycles, but you can save a lot of
memory in your cache backend, and a lot of bandwidth, especially if your
backend is on a distant place. I haven't done any test for this, but for
some templates, the saved data can be reduced from 2 ko to less than
one.

To activate these feature, simply set to ``True`` the settings defined
below.

Settings
^^^^^^^^

``ADV_CACHE_COMPRESS``, default to ``False``, to activate the
compression via ``zlib``

``ADV_CACHE_COMPRESS_SPACES``, default to ``False``, to activate the
reduction of blank characters.

Example
^^^^^^^

No example since you don't have to change anything to your templatetag
call to use thiss, just set the settings.

Choose your cache backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

In django, you can define many cache backends. But with the default
cache templatetag, you cannot say which one use, it will automatically
be the default one.

``django-adv-cache-tag`` can do this for your by provinding a settings,
``ADV_CACHE_BACKEND`` which will take the name of a cache backend
defined in your settings. And by extending the provided ``CacheTag``
object, you can even define many backends to be used by many
templatetags, say one for heavily accessed templates, one for the
others... as you want. Read the ``Extending the default cache tag`` part
to know more about this.

Settings
^^^^^^^^

``ADV_CACHE_BACKEND``, default to "default"

Example
^^^^^^^

No example since, like for the compression, you don't have to change
anything to your templatetag to use this, just set the setting.

Partial caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the default django cache templatetag, your templates are cached and
you can't update them before display, so you can't cache big parts of
html with a little dynamic fragment in it, for the user name, the
current date or whatever. You can cheat and save two templates
surrounding your dynamic part, but you will have more accesses to your
cache backend.

``django-adv-cache-tag`` allow the use of one or many ``{% nocache %}``
blocks (closed by ``{% endnocache %}``) to put in your ``{% cache %}``
blocks. These ``{% nocache %}`` block will be saved "as is" in the
cache, while the rest of the block will be rendered to html. It's only
when the template is finally displayed that the no-cached parts will be
rendered.

You can have as many of these blocks you want.

Settings
^^^^^^^^

There is no settings for this feature, which is automatically activated.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code:: django

    {% cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_updated %}
        <p>This is the cached part of the template for {{ obj }}, evaluated at {% now "r" %}.</p>
        {% nocache %}
            <p>This part will be evaluated each time : {% now "r" %}</p>
        {% endnocache %}
        <p>This is another cached part</p>
    {% endcache %}

Extending the default cache tag
-------------------------------

If the five settings are not enough for you, or if you want to have a
templatag with a different behavior as the default provided one, you
will be happy to know that ``django-adv-cache-tag`` was written with
easily extending in mind.

It provides a class, ``CacheTag`` (in ``adv_cache_tag.tag``), which has
a lot of short and simple methods, and even a ``Meta`` class (idea
stolen from the django models :D ). So it's easy to override a simple
part.

Below we will show many ways of extending this class.

Basic override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine you don't want to change the default settings (all to ``False``,
and using the ``default`` backend) but want a templatetag with
versioning activated :

Create a new templatetag file (``myapp/templatetags/my_cache_tags.py``)
with this:

.. code:: python

    from adv_cache_tag.tag import CacheTag

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):
        class Meta(CacheTag.Meta):
            versioning = True

    from django import template
    register = template.Library()

    MyCacheTag.register(register, 'my_cache')

With these simple lines, you now have a new templatetag to use when you
want versioning:

.. code:: django

    {% load my_cache_tags %}
    {% my_cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_updated %}
        obj
    {% endmycache %}

As you see, just replace ``{% load adv_cache %}`` (or the django default
``{% load cache %}``) by ``{% load my_cache_tags %}``, your templatetag
module, and the ``{% cache %}`` templatetag by your new defined one,
``{% my_cache %}``. Don't forget to replace the closing tag too:
``{% endmy_cache %}``. But the ``{% nocache %}`` will stay the same,
except if you want a new one. For this, just add a parameter to the
``register`` method:

.. code:: python

    MyCacheTag.register(register, 'my_cache', 'my_nocache')

.. code:: django

    {% my_cache ... %}
        cached
        {% my_nocache %}not cached{% endmy_nocache %}
    {% endmy_cache %}

Note that you can keep the name ``cache`` for your tag if you know that
you will not load in your template other templatetag module providing a
``cache`` tag. To do so, two simplest way is:

.. code:: python

    MyCacheTag.register(register) # 'cache' and 'nocache' are the default values

All settings have matching variables in the ``Meta`` class, so you can
override one or many of them in your own classes. See the "Settings"
part to see them

Internal version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your template file is updated, the only way to invalidate all
cached versions of this template is to update the fragment name or the
arguments passed to the templatetag.

With ``django-adv-cache-tag`` you can do this with versioning, by manage
your own version as the last argument to the templetag. But if you want
to use the power of the versioning system of ``django-adv-cache-tag``,
it can be too verbose:

.. code:: django

    {% load adv_cache %}
    {% with template_version=obj.date_last_updated|stringformat:"s"|add:"v1" %}
        {% cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_updated %}
        ...
        {% endcache %}
    {% endwith %}

``django-adv-cache-tag`` provides a way to do this easily, with the
``ADV_CACHE_VERSION`` settings. But by updating it, **all** cached
version will be invalidated, not only those you updated.

To do this, simple create your own tag with a specific internal version:

.. code:: python

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):
        class Meta(CacheTag.Meta):
           internal_version = "v1"
    MyCacheTag.register('my_cache')

And then in your template, you can simply do

.. code:: django

    {% load my_cache_tags %}
    {% my_cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_updated %}
    ...
    {% endmy_cache %}

Each time you update the content of your template and want invalidation,
simply change the ``internal_version`` in your ``MyCacheTag`` class (or
you can use a settings for this)

Change the cache backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to change the cache backend for one templatetag, it's easy:

.. code:: python

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):
        class Meta:
            cache_backend = 'templates'

But you can also to this by overriding a method:

.. code:: python

    from django.core.cache import get_cache

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):
        def get_cache_object(self):
            return get_cache('templates')

And if you want a cache backend for old objects, and another, faster for
recent ones:

.. code:: python

    from django.core.cache import get_cache

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):
        class Meta:
            cache_backend = 'fast_templates'
        def get_cache_object(self):
            cache_backend = self.options.cache_backend
            if self.get_pk() < 1000:
                cache_backend = 'slow_templates'
            return get_cache(cache_backend)

The value returned by the ``get_cache_object`` should be a cache backend
object, but as we only use the ``set`` and ``get`` methods on this
object, it can be what you want if it provides these two methods. And
even more, you can override the ``cache_set`` and ``cache_get`` methods
of the ``CacheTag`` class if you don't want to use the default ``set``
and ``get`` methods of the cache backend object.

Change the cache key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``CacheTag`` class provides three class to create the cache key:

-  ``get_base_cache_key``, which returns a formatable string
   ("template.%(nodename)s.%(name)s.%(pk)s.%(hash)s" by default if
   ``include_pk`` is ``True`` or
   "template.%(nodename)s.%(name)s.%(hash)s" if ``False``
-  ``get_cache_key_args``, which returns the arguments to use in the
   previous string
-  ``get_cache_key``, which combine the two

The arguments are:

-  ``nodename`` parameter is the name of the ``templatetag``: it's
   "my\_cache" if ``{% my_cache ... %}``
-  ``name`` is the "fragment name" of your templatetag, the value after
   the expire-time
-  ``pk`` is used only if ``self.options.include_pk`` is ``True``, and
   is returned by ``this.get_pk()``
-  ``hash`` is the hash of all arguments after the fragment name,
   excluding the last one which is the version number, but only if
   ``self.options.versioning`` is ``True``

If you want to remove the "template." part at the start of the cache key
(useless if you have a cache backend dedicated to template caching), you
can do this:

.. code:: python

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):
        def get_base_cache_key(self):
            cache_key = super(MyCacheTag, self).get_base_cache_key()
            return cache.key[9:]

Add an argument to the templatetag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the templatetags provided by ``CacheTag`` take the same
arguments as the default django cache templatetag.

If you want to add one, it's easy as the class provide a
``get_template_node_arguments`` method, which will work as for normal
django templatetags, taking a list of tokens, and returning ones that
will be passed to the real templatetag, a ``Node`` class inside the
``CacheTag``.

Say you want to add a ``foo`` argument between the expire time and the
fragment name:

.. code:: python

    from django import template

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):

        class Node(CacheTag.Node):
            def __init__(self, nodename, nodelist, expire_time, foo, fragment_name, vary_on):
                """ Save the foo variable in the node (not resolved yet) """
                super(Node, self).__init__(self, nodename, nodelist, expire_time, fragment_name, vary_on)
                self.foo = foo

        def prepare_params(self):
            """ Resolve the foo variable to it's real content """
            super(CacheTag, self).prepare_params()
            self.foo = template.resolve_variable(var, self.context)

        @classmethod
        def get_template_node_arguments(cls, tokens):
            """ Check validity of tokens and return then as ready to be passed to the Node class """
            if len(tokens) < 4:
                raise template.TemplateSyntaxError(u"'%r' tag requires at least 3 arguments." % tokens[0])
            return (tokens[1], tokens[2], tokens[3], tokens[4:])

Prepare caching of templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This one is not about overriding the class, but it can be useful. When
an object is updated, it can be better to regenerate the cached template
at this time rather than we need to display it.

It's easy. You can do this by catching the ``post_save`` signal of your
model, or just override it's ``save`` method. For this example we will
use this last solution.

The only special thing is to know the path of the template where your
templatetag is. In my case, i have a template just for this (included in
other ones for general use), so it's easier to find it and regenerate it
as in this example.

As we are not in a request, we have not the ``Request`` object here, so
context processors are not working, we must create a context object that
will be used to render the template, with all variables needed.

.. code:: python

    from django.template import loader, Context

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # your fields

        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(MyModel, self.save(*args, **kwargs)

            template = 'path/to/my_template_file_with_my_cache_block.html'

            context = Context({
                'obj': self,

                # as you have no request, we have to add stuff from context processors manually if we need them
                'STATIC_URL': settings.STATIC_URL,

                # the line below indicate that we force regenerating the cache, even if it exists
                '__regenerate__': True,

                # the line below indicate if we only want html without parsing the nocache parts
                '__partial__': True,

            })

            loader.get_template(template).render(context)

Load data from database before rendering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a special case. Say that you want to display a list of objects
but you have only ids and versions retrieved from redis (with ``ZSET``,
with as value and updated date (which is used as version) as score , for
example)

If you know you always have a valid version of your template in cache,
because they are regenerated very time they are saved, as seen above,
it's fine, just add the object's primary key as the ``pk`` in your
templatetag arguments, and the cached template will be loaded.

But if it's not the case, you will have a problem: when django will
render the template, the only part of the object present in the context
is the primary key, so if you need the name or whatever field to render
the cached template, it won't work.

With ``django-adv-cache-tag`` it's easy to resolve this, as we can load
the object from the database and adding it to the context.

View
^^^^

.. code:: python

    def my_view(request):
        objects = [
            dict(
                pk=val[0],
                date_last_updated=val[1]
            )
            for val in
                redis.zrevrange('my_objects', 0, 19, withscores=True)
        ]
        return render(request, "my_results.html", dict(objects=objects))

Template "my\_results.html"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: django

    {% for obj in objects %}
        {% include "my_result.html" %}
    {% endfor %}

Template "my\_result.html"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: django

    {% load my_cache_tags %}
    {% my_cache 0 myobj_main_template obj.pk obj.date_last_update %}
        {{ obj }}
    {% endmy_cache %}

Templatetag
^^^^^^^^^^^

in "myapp/templatetags/my\_cache\_tags "

.. code:: python

    from my_app.models import MyModel

    class MyCacheTag(CacheTag):

        class Meta(CacheTag.Meta):
            """ Force options """
            include_pk = True
            versioning = True

        def create_content(self):
            """ If the object in context is not a real model, load it from db """
            if not isinstance(context['obj'], MyObject):
                context['obj'] = MyModel.objects.get(id=self.get_pk())
            super(MyCacheTag, self).create_content()

    MyCacheTag.register('my_cache')

Careful with this, it generates as database requests as objects to be
loaded.

And more...
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to do more, feel free to look at the source code of the
``CacheTag`` class (in ``tag.py``), all methods are documented.

Settings
--------

``django-adv-cache-tag`` provide 5 settings you can change. Here are the
list, with description, default value, and corresponding field in the
``Meta`` class (accessible via ``self.options.some_field`` in the
``CacheTag`` object)

-  ``ADV_CACHE_VERSIONING`` to activate versioning, default to ``False``
   (``versioning`` in the ``Meta`` class)
-  ``ADV_CACHE_COMPRESS`` to activate compression, default to ``False``
   (``compress`` in the ``Meta`` class)
-  ``ADV_CACHE_COMPRESS_SPACES`` to activate spaces compression, default
   to ``False`` (``compress_spaces`` in the ``Meta`` class)
-  ``ADV_CACHE_INCLUDE_PK`` to activate the "primary key" feature,
   default to ``False`` (``include_pk`` in the ``Meta`` class)
-  ``ADV_CACHE_BACKEND`` to choose the cache backend to use, default to
   ``"default"`` (``cache_backend`` in the ``Meta`` class)
-  ``ADV_CACHE_VERSION`` to create your own internal version (will be
   concatened to the real internal version of ``django-adv-cache-tag``),
   default to ``""`` (``internal_version`` in the ``Meta`` class)

How it works
------------

Here is a quick overview on how things work in ``django-adv-cache-tag``

Partial caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your template :

.. code:: django

    {% load adv_cache %}
    {% cache ... %}
        foo
        {% nocache %}
            bar
        {% endnocache %}
        baz
    {% endcache %}

Cached version (we ignore versioning and compress here, just to see how
it works):

.. code:: django

    foo
    {% endRAW_xyz %}
        bar
    {% RAW_xyz %}
    baz

When cached version is loaded, we parse :

.. code:: django

    {% RAW_xyz %}
    foo
    {% endRAW_xyz %}
        bar
    {% RAW_xyz %}
    baz
    {% endRAW_xyz %}

The first ``{% RAW_xyz %}`` and the last ``{% endRAW_xyz %}`` are not
included in the cached version and added before parsing, only to save
some bytes.

Parts between ``{% RAW_xyz %}`` and ``{% endRAW_xyz %}`` are not parsed
at all (seen as a ``TextNode`` by django)

The ``xyz`` part of the ``RAW`` and ``endRAW`` templatetags depends on
the ``SECRET_KEY`` and so is unique for a given site.

It allows to avoid at max the possible collisions with parsed content in
the cached version.

We could use ``{% nocache %}`` and ``{% endnocache %}`` instead of
``{% RAW_xyz %}`` and ``{% endRAW_xyz %}`` but... it the parsed
template, stored in the cache results in a html including one of these
strings, our final template would be broken, so we use long ones with a
hash (but we can not be sure at 100% these strings could not be in the
cached html, but for common usages it should suffice)
