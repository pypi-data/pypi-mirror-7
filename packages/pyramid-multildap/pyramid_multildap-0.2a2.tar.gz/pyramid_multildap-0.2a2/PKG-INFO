Description: ``pyramid_multildap``
        =====================
        
        ``pyramid_multildap`` is a friendly fork of `pyramid_ldap`_,
        incorporating some changes which have been proposed upstream,
        but have not been accepted (yet?).
        
        The package is being developed at github:
        
        https://github.com/lmctv/pyramid_multildap
        
        .. include:: ORIG_README.rst
        
        .. _`pyramid_ldap`: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap
        
        
        Original README follows:
        
        ``pyramid_ldap``
        ================
        
        ``pyramid_ldap`` provides LDAP authentication services for your Pyramid
        application.  Thanks to the ever-awesome `SurveyMonkey
        <http://surveymonkey.com>`_ for sponsoring the development of this package!
        
        See the documentation at
        http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_ldap/en/latest/ for more
        information.
        
        This package will only work with Pyramid 1.3a9 and better.
        
        
        Changes:
        Next release
        ------------
        
        - Add attrlist to LDAPQuery, set_login_query, set_groups_query to allow
          retrieved attributes to be filtered. (Default: All attributes on users, no
          attributes on groups). See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/8
        
        - Support creation of multiple co-existing ldap contexts in the same
          application. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/6
        
        - Add a "search_after_bind" attribute to the _LDAPQuery class, to
          help in reading directory entry attributes when the directory server
          is configured to hide them in the before login search phase.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/5
        
        - Set a size limit on pre-login entry dn searches.
        
        - Escape user-provided login names, avoiding server errors or trivial
          DOSs caused by user names like 'user*name' or 'user(middle)name'
        
        - Prevent the use of zero-length password authentication.  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_ldap/pull/13
