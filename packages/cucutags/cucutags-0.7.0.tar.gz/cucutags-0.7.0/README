cucutags provides a simple generator of ctags-like tags file for
the combination of [Gherkin language features](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) and Python [steps](https://github.com/behave/behave).

Unfortunately, no text editor known to me is able to use so generated
tags file. However, this script can be also used by any other Python
script as a library, and thus for example [vim](http://www.vim.org) can
use it via [vim-behave](https://gitorious.org/cucutags/vim-behave)
plugin or [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) via the
[gedit_behave](https://gitorious.org/cucutags/gedit_behave) one.

All bug reports and enhancement requests, please, send to the
email listed in the script file.
