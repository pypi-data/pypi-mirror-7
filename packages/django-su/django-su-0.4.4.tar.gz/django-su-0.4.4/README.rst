Installation
============

Step 1: Settings
----------------

Add ``django_su`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Make sure you put it *before* ``django.contrib.admin``.

Next add the ``django-su`` authentication backend::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        # Standard Django auth
        "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",
        # django-su auth
        "django_su.backends.SuBackend",
    )


Step 2: urls.py
---------------

Add this to your root ``urls.py`` file::

    url(r"^su/", include("django_su.urls")),

And that should be it!

Step 3: Install other eggs (optional, but recommended)
------------------------------------------------------

If you install these two eggs the enhance user experience:

 * The 'login su' form will render using `django admin forms`_
 * The user selection widget will render using `django ajax selects`_

Note that `django ajax selects`_ requires the following settings::

    AJAX_LOOKUP_CHANNELS = {'django_su':  dict(model='auth.user', search_field='username')}

Step 4: Customize django_su (optional)
--------------------------------------

In your settings you can configure:

 * ``SU_REDIRECT_LOGIN``: URL to redirect after the login. By default is "/"
 * ``SU_REDIRECT_EXIT``: URL to redirect after the logout. By default is "/"
 * ``SU_LOGIN``: A function to specify the perms that the user must have can use django_su

Usage
-----

Go and view a user in the admin interface and look for a new 'Login as' button in the top right.

Once you have su'ed into a user, you can get exit back into your original user by navigating to ``/su/`` in your browser.
