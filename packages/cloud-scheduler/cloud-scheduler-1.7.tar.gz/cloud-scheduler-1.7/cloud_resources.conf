## Explanation of each attribute
############################################################

# Name of Cluster:
# Each cluster needs to have a name. Put this in square brackets.
# Each attribute for the cluster must go underneath it. 
#
#[example]

# Host Name or IP address of Cluster:
# The publicly accessible hostname or IP address 
# of each cluster head node.
#
# When the Cloud Type is AmazonEC2, this will be
# ec2.amazonaws.com no matter what you put here.
#
#host: cloud.example.com 

# Cloud Type:
# The Cloud software installed on the cluster. 
# Possible values are Nimbus, AmazonEC2, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, OpenStack
#
#cloud_type: Nimbus

# Hypervisor:
# The underlying hypervisor used by the cloud
# Possible values are kvm, xen
#
#hypervisor: xen

# Virtual Machine Slots:
# The Maximum Number of virtual machines that can be 
# run on a cluster at a time
#
# When using AmazonEC2, think of this as the maximum
# number of VMs to use with this service.
#
#vm_slots: 10

# CPU Cores per Machine:
# The number of CPU cores per worker node machine
#
#cpu_cores: 2

# Total CPU Cores in Cloud:
# Causes CS to keep track of cpu cores available - default -1

#total_cpu_cores: -1

# Storage Space on the Cluster:
# The sum total of storage available on all worker nodes of the
# cluster.
#
# (eg: 4 nodes with ~25 GB each = 100)
#storage: 100

# Maximum VM Storage size: (Nimbus Only)
# The largest amount of blankdisk (in GB) request that is allowed for this cluster.
#max_vm_storage: 10

# Memory on Virtual Machines:
# A comma separated list of the memory (in MB) available to VMs
# on each cluster worker node
#
#memory: 2048, 2048

# Maximum VM Memory size: (Nimbus Only)
# The largest memory (in MB) request that is allowed for this cluster.
#max_vm_mem: 2048

# VM Lifetime: (Nimbus Only)
# The Length of time to make requests for(in Minutes - 10080=1 Week), 
# if not set will use the global vm_lifetime setting in cloud_scheduler.conf
#vm_lifetime: 10080

# CPU Architectures Available:
# A comma separated list of the CPU architectures
# available on the cluster worker nodes.
# Currently supports x86, x86_64
#cpu_archs: x86

# Network Pools Available: (Nimbus Only)
# A comma separated list of the network pools
# on the cluster (from which VMs may lease network slots)
#
#networks: private

# image_attach_device is the device the image specified for a job is attached (Nimbus Only)
#image_attach_device:sda

# scratch_attach_device is the device the scratch space specified for a job is
# attached to. (Nimbus Only)
#scratch_attach_device:sdb

# EC2 Query API Access Key ID: (AmazonEC2, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, OpenStack)
# The access key id of the user account you would like to
# use with this cluster.
#
#access_key_id: xxxxxxx

# EC2 Query API Secret Key: (AmazonEC2, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, OpenStack)
# The secret access key of the user account you would like to
# use with this cluster.
#
#secret_access_key: xxx

# EC2 Key Name: (AmazonEC2, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, OpenStack)
# The name of the key pair to run instances with. (Optional)
#
#key_name: xxx

# EC2 Security Group: (AmazonEC2, Eucalyptus, OpenStack)
# The EC2 Security group that your worker VMs will be a part of.
#
# If unset, your VMs will be in the default security group
#security_group: xxx

# Cloud Priority: (All)
# The priority weight you want to boot VMs on this cloud
# Higher number, lower priority
# 
# If unset clouds will receive the default priority of 0
#priority: 0
