Description: 
        
        Municiaplities for which we contribute to `OneGov`_ often require a public list
        of contacts. For the customers and us this package needs to scratch the
        following itches:
        
        - The directory must not force a set of fields on the user. Each customer
          should have the option to create its own set of fields. At the same time
          there should be at least one reasonable standard.
        
        - Some fields should only be visible with certain permissions. Think mobile
          phone number.
        
        - Elected officials are part of many comitees and councils. It must be easy
          to define the timespans during which any person was part of such an
          organization. It must also always be clear what the role of the person was.
        
        Design
        ------
        
        This is how we plan to scratch the aforementioned itches:
        
        - We give the user the possiblity to define a list of people. Each list
          consists of a number of dexterity objects with IPerson behavior. Within
          one list only one dexterity type is allowed.
        
        - Through the schema of the dexterity type we define the fields, their
          required read and write permissions, the fields shown in the list, the order
          of those fields, the fields available for filtering in the list, and the 
          fields shown in the detail view.
        
        - These dexterity types may be installed by any package or they may be included
          in seantis.people, available through separate profiles. (It's technically
          even possible to create them through the web, but we don't recommend this
          approach for various reasons.)
        
        - We devine an organzation-behavior which any folderish dexterity type may 
          adapt. Types with that behavior may then have people added to them with
          entry, exit and role information.
        
        - We display the memberships of each person using the entry, exit and role
          information. We identity the organization solely by url and title. This will
          give users the ability to have some plone page act as an organization, which
          frees os from having to reinvent the wheel there.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        The people types and list are pretty much ready for a first release. We are
        currently working on the organisation part of the module.
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        After a reindex, the people's list no longer shows the organization memberships.
        This is documented with a workaround in the following issue:

        Alternatives

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.19 (2014-06-24)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Adds a navigation bar to the person detail view. Fixes #17.
          [href]
        
        - The export now also works with richtext fields. Fixes #18.
          [href]
        
        0.18 (2014-05-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Adds the ability to do an unrestricted search on the people's list.
          [href]
        
        0.17 (2014-03-31)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Adds support for url, date and datetime fields to the import.
          [href]
        
        - Adds the ability to export people to csv, xls, xlsx or json.
          [href]
        
        - Adds 'is_active_person' property which if present and False hides the given
          person from the person list for anonymous users.
          [href]
        
        - Removes start/end on memberships. This module will no longer deal with
          memberships over time. Where this is required, external modules like
          seantis.kantonsrat have to do this themselves.
          [href]
        
        - Images on the people's list are rendered smaller and in the detail view they
          are rendered larger. Renderes now have custom options for this case.
          [href]
        
        - Adds the ability to define custom titles on the person. Currently the custom
          title is only relevant for the detail view. To use add a custom_titles
          dictionary to the person object with the key being the field anme and the
          value being the title that should be used in the detail view.
          [href]
        
        - Adds a new LinkList type which may be used returned by person attributes.
          The link list will be rendered using ul > li > a.
          [href]
        
        - Organization memberships are now queried by interface in the ZODB, rather
          than by portal_type to support inheritance.
        
        - Changes membership id/title to include the role as well as the name of
          the referenced person. Closes #13.
          [href]
        
        - Fixes a crash when viewing a public directory with private organisations.
          Closes #12.
          [href]
        
        - Adds a note field to the membership.
          [href]
        
        - Adds the ability to define the years_range for plone.formwidget.datetime
          widgets used in the schemas. Fixes #11.
          [href]
