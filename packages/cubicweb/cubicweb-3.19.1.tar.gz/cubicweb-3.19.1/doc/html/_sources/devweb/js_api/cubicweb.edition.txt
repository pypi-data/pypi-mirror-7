this function is called when an AJAX form was generated to
make sure tabindex remains consistent

.. function:: _showMatchingSelect(eid, divNode)

.. function:: buildPendingInsertHandle(elementId, element_name, selectNodeId, eid)

.. function:: addInlineCreationForm(peid, petype, ttype, rtype, role, i18nctx, insertBefore)

makes an AJAX request to get an inline-creation view's content
* `peid`, the parent entity eid

* `petype`, the parent entity type

.. function:: unfreezeFormButtons(formid)

unfreeze form buttons when the validation process is over

.. function:: freezeFormButtons(formid)

disable form buttons while the validation is being done

.. function:: postForm(bname, bvalue, formid)

used by additional submit buttons to remember which button was clicked

.. function:: setFormsTarget(node)

called on load to set target and iframeso object.

.. note::

   This was a hack to make form loop handling XHTML compliant.
   Since we do not care about xhtml any longer, this may go away.

.. note::

  `object` nodes might be a potential replacement for iframes

.. note::

   The form's `target` attribute should probably become a simple data-target
   immediately generated server-side.
   Since we don't do xhtml any longer, the iframe should probably be either
   reconsidered or at least emitted server-side.

.. function:: validateForm(formid, action, onsuccess, onfailure)

called on traditionnal form submission : the idea is to try
to post the form. If the post is successful, `validateForm` redirects
to the appropriate URL. Otherwise, the validation errors are displayed
around the corresponding input fields.
