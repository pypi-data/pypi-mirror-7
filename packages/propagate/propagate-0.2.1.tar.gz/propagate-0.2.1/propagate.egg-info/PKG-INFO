Description: ==============================
        Belief Propagation in Networks
        ==============================
        
        Belief propagation is a general graph algorithm for ranking nodes
        based on their location in the graph and some prior knowledge. 
        
        The network is using in machine learning and bioinformatics in a variety 
        of applications.
        
        This package implements the algorithm and provides a command line interface 
        to run it.
