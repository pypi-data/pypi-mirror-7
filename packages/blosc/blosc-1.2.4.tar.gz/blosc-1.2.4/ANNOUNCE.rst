=============================
Announcing python-blosc 1.2.4
=============================

What is new?
============

This is a maintenance release, where included c-blosc sources have been
updated to 1.4.0.  This added support for non-Intel architectures, most
specially those not supporting unaligned access.

For more info, you can have a look at the release notes in:

https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc/wiki/Release-notes

More docs and examples are available in the documentation site:

What is it?
===========

python-blosc (http://blosc.pydata.org/) is a Python wrapper for the
Blosc compression library.

Blosc (http://blosc.org) is a high performance compressor optimized for
binary data.  It has been designed to transmit data to the processor
cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch
approach via a memcpy() OS call.  Whether this is achieved or not
depends of the data compressibility, the number of cores in the system,
and other factors.  See a series of benchmarks conducted for many
different systems: http://blosc.org/trac/wiki/SyntheticBenchmarks.

Blosc works well for compressing numerical arrays that contains data
with relatively low entropy, like sparse data, time series, grids with
regular-spaced values, etc.

There is also a handy command line for Blosc called Bloscpack
(https://github.com/esc/bloscpack) that allows you to compress large
binary datafiles on-disk.  Although the format for Bloscpack has not
stabilized yet, it allows you to effectively use Blosc from your
favorite shell.
