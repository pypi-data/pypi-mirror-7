PyGitUpAll |Build Status|
=========================

Git-Up all your projects!

Why use ``git-up-all`` ?
------------------------

 - Tired of going into each repo and ``pulling/rebasing/stashing`` in order to update
 - Tired of updating all branches over all the repos you have following the above tactics?
 - Need one custom action for sourcetree for eg? Just add ``git-up-all --sourcetree`` and you are good to go

How it works
------------

1. Reads a json file (or SourceTree list OSX) containing the list of repos you want to keep updated (could also be sourced controlled).

2. Iterates over each folder containing the repos provided and executes git-up as a module

3. Prints results for each repo

- Note that it will skip any fails and leaves it up to the user to manually resolve the conflicts.

Setup
-----

 - Install via ``pip install git-up-all``
 - Create a ``projects.json`` containing a list of projects (see example below) or use ``--sourcetree``
 - Run ``git-up-all`` on that folder containing the projects.json or use ``--sourcetree``


projects.json
-------------

This file should contain a list with projects/repos as below:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "gitup": {
            "name": "PyGitUp",
            "git_url": "https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp.git",
            "absolute_path": "/Users/jimmykane/projects/pygitup"
        },
        "gitupall": {
            "name": "PyGitUpAll",
            "git_url": "https://github.com/jimmykane/PyGitUpAll.git",
            "absolute_path": "/Users/jimmykane/projects/pygitupall"
        }
    }
