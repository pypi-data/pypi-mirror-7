        =======================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
            `pyramid_cas` allows your application to authenticate against a Jasig CAS server.
            It takes borrowed concepts from different packages like django.cas, anz.client, and collective.cas.
        
        License
        ============
        
            `pyramid_cas` is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
        
        Installation
        ============
        ::
        
            pip install pyramid_cas
        
        Instructions
        ============
            Required:
        
                Include pyramid_cas under pyramid.includes directive in your .ini file like this::
        
                    pyramid.includes =
                        [... other packages ...]
                        pyramid_cas
        
                Set the cas server that will be used for authentication::
        
                    pyramid_cas.cas_server = your-cas-server
                    pyramid_cas.redirect_route    - allows you to specify what route name to redirect to after succesful authentication
        
            Optional::
        
                pyramid_cas.callback.get_user - allows you to use a callback function to store a different User object after CAS authentication.
                                                By default pyramid_cas will store (using the pyramid remember method) only the user id returned by CAS.
                
            Example::
        
                pyramid_cas.callback.get_user = adminsite.security.getUserObject
                pyramid_cas.redirect_route = profile  # redirects to profile page on successful authentication
        
            Use the following route names for login and logout in your application::
        
                cas-login
                cas-logout
        
        TODO
        ====
            - Implement CAS 1.0 protocol
            - Add login and logout by injection and makes it configurable using tweens
            - Add tests
            - Add demos
            - Prevent adding pyramid_cas without settings
            - Add came_from parameter
