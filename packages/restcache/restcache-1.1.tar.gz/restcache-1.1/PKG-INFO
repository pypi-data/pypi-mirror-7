Description: 
        Caching JSON REST API Get Queries
        =================================
        
        I wrote this so I could stop abusing people's REST APIs whenever I was
        developing tools. Currently this will only cache GET requests, and
        nothing else. If you want more features, let me know!
        
        Quick Usage:
        
        ::
        
            from restcache import QueryCache
            qc = QueryCache()
            qc.json_query('https://bitbucket.org/api/1.0/repositories/galaxy/galaxy-central/tags/')
        
        The ``json_query`` call makes a ``urllib2`` request, and stores it in
        ``.cache/{base64 encoded url}``.
        
        On initialization, QueryCache will check through the cache directory and
        load any files.
