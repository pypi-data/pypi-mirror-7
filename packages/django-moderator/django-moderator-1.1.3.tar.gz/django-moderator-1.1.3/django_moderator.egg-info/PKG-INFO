        ``django-moderator`` integrates Django's comments framework classify comments into one of four categories, *ham*, *spam*, *reported* or *unsure*.
        
        Users classify comments as *reported* using a *report abuse* mechanic. Staff users can then classify these *reported* comments as *ham* or *spam*.
        
        Comments classified as *spam* will have their ``is_removed`` field set to ``True`` and as such will no longer be visible in comment listings.
        
        Comments *reported* by users will have their ``is_removed`` field set to ``True`` and as such will no longer be visible in comment listings.
        
        Comments classified as *ham* or *unsure* will remain unchanged and as such will be visible in comment listings.
        
        ``django-moderator`` also implements a user friendly admin interface for efficiently moderating comments.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        #. Install or add ``django-moderator`` to your Python path.
        
        #. Add ``moderator`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        #. Configure ``django-likes`` as described `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-likes>`_.
        
        #. Configure ``django-celery`` and add ``moderator.tasks`` to the ``CELERY_IMPORTS = (..., 'moderator.tasks')``
        
        #. Add a ``MODERATOR`` setting to your project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies what classifier storage backend to use (see below) and also classification thresholds::
        
            MODERATOR = {
                'ABUSE_CUTOFF': 3,
            }
        
           `ABUSE_CUTOFF`` value of ``3`` as in this example specifies that any comment receiving ``3`` or more abuse reports will be classified as *reported*, awaiting further manual staff user classification.
        
        #. Optionally, if you want an additional **moderate** object tool on admin change views, configure ``django-apptemplates`` as described `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-apptemplates>`_ , include ``moderator`` as an ``INSTALLED_APP`` before ``django.contrib.admin`` and add ``moderator.admin.AdminModeratorMixin`` as a base class to those admin classes you want the tool available for.
        
        Additional Settings
        -------------------
        #. By default moderator comment replies are posted chronologically **after** the comment being replied to. If however you need replies to be posted **before** the comment being replied to(for example if you display your comments reverse cronologically), you can specify ``REPLY_BEFORE_COMMENT`` as ``True``, i.e.::
        
            MODERATOR = {
                ...
                'REPLY_BEFORE_COMMENT': True,
                ...
            }
