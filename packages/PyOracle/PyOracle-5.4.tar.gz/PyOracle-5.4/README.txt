About
-----
PyOracle is a Python library for machine musical improvisation and analysis 
in the family of software built around the Factor Oracle and Audio Oracle algorithms. 
One of the main innovations in PyOracle is using functions related to
 Music Information Dynamics for tuning of sound models with multiple sound features. 
A symbolic version also allows working with MusicXML and use of 
musical rules for controlling the generation of sound.
