A brainstorm of the test cases we need:

X recursively parse a recipe to list of tiddler-like data structures
X parse .tiddlers, .tid and .js files
X parse a tiddlywiki to a list of tiddler-like data structures

* distinguish between importing into a bag and caching for instancer
  (this may happen automagically)

X import a binary thing into a bag?
* import a tarball or zipfile into a bag binariwise?

BIG: We need to validate in the face of unicode situations.

We need to more robust about bad input.
