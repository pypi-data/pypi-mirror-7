WARN: This command is incomplete!
TODO: Implement
How is this intended to be different than deleting a process?  Perhaps rather
than deleting a process we can bundle it up into a ZIP file and store it i
a project? That would require an object property that identifies a project
for storage and potentially a path.... yes, this sounds like a really swell
idea.  That archive can then be browsed and examined using simple filesystem
projects.  We can certainly use the TarFile module to move the data intoa
tar file.
