Description: crowdflower
        ===========
        
        Minimal client library for interacting with the
        `CrowdFlower <http://www.crowdflower.com/>`__ API with Python.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from github at this point:
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/chbrown/crowdflower.git
            cd crowdflower
            python setup.py develop
        
        Example use
        -----------
        
        Import:
        
        ::
        
            import crowdflower
        
        CrowdFlower API keys are 20 characters long; the one below is just
        random characters.
        
        ::
        
            conn = crowdflower.Connection('LbcxvIlE3x1M8F6TT5hN')
        
        This library will default to an environment variable called
        ``CROWDFLOWER_API_KEY`` if none is specified here:
        
        ::
        
            conn = crowdflower.Connection()
        
        Loop through all your jobs and print the titles:
        
        ::
        
            for job in conn.jobs():
                print job['title']
        
        Create a new job with some new units:
        
        ::
        
            job = conn.upload(data)
            print job
        
        Fancy stuff
        -----------
        
        Run a bunch of DELETE calls on each item in the job.
        
        ::
        
            for delete_response in job.clear_units():
                print delete_response
        
        If you don't want to print the responses, you still need to exhaust the
        loop:
        
        ::
        
            list(job.clear_units())
