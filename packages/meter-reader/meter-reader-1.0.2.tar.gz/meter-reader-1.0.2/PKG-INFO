Description: Meter Reader is a client library and command line client for retrieving
        nearly realtime energy usage data from a smart meter via the Eagle™ Home
        Energy Gateway. See
        `Rainforest™ Automation <http://www.rainforestautomation.com>`_ for more
        about the Eagle™ Home Energy Gateway.
        
        Meter Reader is not affiliated with the Eagle™ Home Energy Gateway or
        Rainforest™ Automation.
        
        Installation
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install meter-reader
        
        Usage
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Meter Reader is intended to be used as a library for other applications
        but it does contain a command line application called mr.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ mr < ip address >
        
        This will run the ``LIST_DEVICES`` devices command on the gateway and display
        a formatted response. Other commands, such as ``GET_DEVICE_DATA``, will first
        run the ``LIST_DEVICES`` command to determine the MAC address of the gateway.
        
        Commands can be specified with the `'-c'` option. For example
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ mr -c GET_DEVICE_DATA < ip address >

        There are two ways to retrieve instantaneous demand:
        
        1. Send the ``GET_INSTANTANEOUS_DEMAND`` command directly to the gateway. This
           will return a nearly raw response from the gateway (formatting is applied).
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ mr -c GET_INSTANTANEOUS_DEMAND < ip address >
        
                InstantaneousDemand
                DeviceMacId         xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
                MeterMacId          xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
                TimeStamp           2014-04-19 15:35:27+00:00
                Demand              297
                Multiplier          1
                Divisor             1000
                DigitsRight         3
                DigitsLeft          15
                SuppressLeadingZero Y
        
        2. Supply the ``--get-instant-demand`` argument. This will post-process the
        response before displaying it.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ mr --get-instant-demand < ip address >
        
            2014-04-19 15:58:39+00:00, 0.292kW
        
        Raw and unformatted data returned by the gatway, can be viewed by using the
        `'-r'` option.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ mr -r -c GET_DEVICE_DATA < ip address >
        
        Including Meter Reader in an application
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from meter_reader import Gateway
        
            GATEWAY_ADDRESS = '192.168.1.10'
        
            gw = Gateway(GATEWAY_ADDRESS)
            response = gw.run_command('GET_DEVICE_DATA')
            print('Network Info')
            print(response['NetworkInfo'])
        
            timestamp, demand = gw.get_instantaneous_demand()
            print('Demand {0!s} at {1!s}'.format(demand, timestamp))
