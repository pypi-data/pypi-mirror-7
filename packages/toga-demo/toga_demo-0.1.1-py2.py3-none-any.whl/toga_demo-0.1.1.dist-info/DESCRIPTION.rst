Toga Demo
=========

A demonstration of the capabilities of the Toga widget toolkit.

Quickstart
----------

In your virtualenv, install Toga Demo, and then run it::

    $ pip install toga-demo
    $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window.

Problems using virtualenv under Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toga uses the system native python GTK+3 bindings for display purposes.
However, if you're using a `--no-site-packages` virtualenv, the Python bindings
for GTK won't be in your `PYTHONPATH`.

Unfortunately, you can't `pip install` GTK+ bindings, so you have to use a
workaround. To make the system GTK+ bindings available to your virtualenv,
symlinking the `gi` module from the system dist-packages directory into your
virtualenv's site-packages::

    $ cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    $ ln -si /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi
