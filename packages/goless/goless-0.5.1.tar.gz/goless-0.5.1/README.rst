goless
======

The **goless** library provides **Go** programming language
semantics, such as channels, select, and goroutines,
built on top of **gevent**, **PyPy**, or **Stackless Python**.
It works with PyPy, CPython, and Stackless Python interpreters.

Using goless, you can write Go-style concurrent programs in Python.

**goless** has extensive documentation and examples.
See https://goless.readthedocs.org/ for more information.
