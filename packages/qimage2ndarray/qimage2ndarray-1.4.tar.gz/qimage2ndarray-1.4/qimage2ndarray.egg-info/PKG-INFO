Description: qimage2ndarray is a small python extension for quickly converting
        between QImages and numpy.ndarrays (in both directions).  These are
        very common tasks when programming e.g. scientific visualizations in
        Python using PyQt4 as the GUI library.
        
        * Supports conversion of scalar and RGB data, with arbitrary dtypes
          and memory layout, with and without alpha channels, into QImages
          (e.g. for display or saving using Qt).
        
        * qimage2ndarray makes it possible to create ndarrays_ that are
          *views* into a given QImage_'s memory.
        
          This allows for very efficient data handling and makes it possible
          to modify Qt image data in-place (e.g. for brightness/gamma or alpha
          mask modifications).
        
        * `Masked arrays`_ are also supported and are converted into QImages
          with transparent pixels.
        
        * Supports value scaling / normalization to 0..255 for convenient
          display of arbitrary NumPy arrays.
