Description:       KineticLib
              ==========
        
              Provides a library with various functions used in computational kinetic theory.
              Aimed at the multi-temperature (and one-temperature as a special case) and state-to-state approximations.

              Roadmap (major additions)
              =========================
        
              * More vibrational models - Landau-Teller, SSH
        
              Current issues
              ==============
        
              #. VV probabilities seem to be wrong for multi-quantum transitions. Needs more thorough literature checks
        
              #. Rotational relaxation times calculated using a strict definition seem to be off by a factor of 2.
