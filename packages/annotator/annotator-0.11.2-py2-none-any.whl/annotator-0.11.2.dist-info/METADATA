Annotator Store
===============

This is a backend store for `Annotator <http://annotatorjs.org>`__.

Getting going
-------------

You'll need a recent version of `Python <http://python.org>`__ (>=2.6)
and `ElasticSearch <http://elasticsearch.org>`__ (>=1.0.0) installed
(although see "ElasticSearch compatibility" below).

The quickest way to get going requires the ``pip`` and ``virtualenv``
tools (``easy_install virtualenv`` will get them both). Run the
following in the repository root::

    virtualenv pyenv
    source pyenv/bin/activate
    pip install -e .
    cp annotator.cfg.example annotator.cfg
    python run.py

You should see something like::

    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    * Restarting with reloader...

If you wish to customize the configuration of the Annotator Store, make
your changes to ``annotator.cfg`` or dive into ``run.py``.

Store API
---------

The Store API is designed to be compatible with the
`Annotator <http://okfnlabs.org/annotator>`__. The annotation store, a
JSON-speaking REST API, will be mounted at ``/api`` by default. See the
`Annotator
documentation <https://github.com/okfn/annotator/wiki/Storage>`__ for
details.

Running tests
-------------

We use ``nosetests`` to run tests. You can just
``pip install nosetests mock``, ensure ElasticSearch is running, and
then::

    $ nosetests
    ....................................................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 52 tests in 3.233s

    OK

Alternatively (and preferably), you should install
`Tox <http://tox.testrun.org/>`__, and then run ``tox``. This will run
the tests against multiple versions of Python (if you have them
installed).

Please `open an issue <annotator-store/issues>`__ if you find that the
tests don't all pass on your machine, making sure to include the output
of ``pip freeze``.

Elasticsearch compatibility
---------------------------

The store should ideally be run against Elasticsearch version 1.0.0 or
greater, but can also be run against the legacy 0.90.x series (and
possibly even earlier) if desired. In order to do this, set the
following configuration option::

    ELASTICSEARCH_COMPATIBILITY_MODE = 'pre-1.0.0'

and ensure that you have installed a version of the ``elasticsearch``
library from the 0.4.x series::

    pip install 'elasticsearch>0.4,<0.5'

**NB:** This mode of operation is deprecated. Support will be dropped
for Elasticsearch 0.90.x in the future.
