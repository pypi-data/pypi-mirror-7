Nanotubes 
============

Although NanoCap was designed to produce fullerenes and cap nanotubes, isolated nanotubes can be constructed. These can be either finite 
in length or periodic along the axial direction.

A nanotube is constructed via:

*File->New Structure->Single Structure*

the click *Nanotube* from the popup menu.

Finite tubes
------------

Finite tubes are simply constructed as close to the user defined length as possible. 
This length is defined in the **Calculations->Input** options.
 
Periodic tubes
--------------

Periodic tubes are constructed using a user defined number of unit cells in the *z* direction. 
The number of unit cells can also be found in the **Calculations->Input** options.

The nanotube will be associated with a *periodic length* which can be found in the
**Information** options tab. This will be required by simulation software if the nanotube is to be
used in a periodic simulation.
