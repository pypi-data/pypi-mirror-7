1.1.0-beta, 13/05/14
--------------------

	- Significant overall of underlying code and class structure. The Structure base class
	now holds may useful methods. Removal of processes module which improves transparency 
	within the code.

	- Introduction of SQLite database using the sqlite3 module for python. Stored in the 
	nanocap user directory. Holds all structures and associated information. NanoCap can 
	now be used as a simpler viewer of previously constructed structures.
	
	- Added unified data model such that the SQL database and session structure logs work 
	with a consistent data format. 
	
	- Tests and User scripts are now release dependent, and are bundled with the src.


1.0.2-alpha , 19/12/13
----------------------

	- Added scaled topology generation. The fullerenes and/or capped nanotubes are scaled
	to give the roughly the correct C-C bond length. Simple optimisation to minimise the 
	residual square difference between oberserved and current bond lengths. 
	
	- Move ring calcuation routines to it's own module and added calls in the fullerene
	and capped nanotube classes
	
	- Added cappednanotube class, which holds nanotube, cap and reflected cap objects. 
	Dual lattice points and carbon atoms are constructed by joining the pointSets 
	together.
	
	- Added volume and surface area calculation for fullerenes. Uses divergence theorem
	and the carbon atom rings. The normal to each ring is used along with the surface area
	to determine the volume. Sphericity is then calculated.  

1.0.1-alpha , 02/12/13
----------------------

Win32
    - Issue with embedding the vtk window in a qt widget. Mainly due to return
    value of vtk_object.winId() not being compatible with qt_widget.SetWindowInfo()
    winId() return val is platform specific. On windows returns PyCObject, so have to:

        WId = self.winId()

        if type(WId).__name__ == 'PyCObject':
            from ctypes import pythonapi, c_void_p, py_object
        
            pythonapi.PyCObject_AsVoidPtr.restype  = c_void_p
            pythonapi.PyCObject_AsVoidPtr.argtypes = [py_object]
        
            WId = pythonapi.PyCObject_AsVoidPtr(WId)
        
        self._RenderWindow.SetWindowInfo(str(int(WId))) 

    - Had to turn off the rendering multithreading - need to relook at modifying 
    opengl objects between threads. Ensure only done on the gui thread loop.


1.0-alpha
-----------
	- Initial release. Primary development on OS X 10.7.
