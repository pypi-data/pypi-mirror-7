\section{Introduction}


NanoCap provides both libraries and a standalone application for the construction 
of capped nanotubes of arbitrarily chirality and fullerenes of any radius. Structures 
are generated by constructing a set of optimal dual graph topologies which 
are subsequently optimised using a carbon interatomic potential. Combining 
this approach with a GUI featuring 3D rendering capabilities allows for the rapid 
inspection of physically sensible structures which can be used as input for 
molecular simulation. 

The NanoCap source and builds for different platforms can be found at:
