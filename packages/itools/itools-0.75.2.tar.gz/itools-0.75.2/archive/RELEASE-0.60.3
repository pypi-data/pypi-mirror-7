itools 0.60.3 (2009/07/17)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.abnf             itools.i18n             itools.stl
  itools.core             itools.ical             itools.tmx
  itools.csv              itools.odf              itools.uri
  itools.datatypes        itools.pdf              itools.vfs
  itools.gettext          itools.pkg              itools.web
  itools.git              itools.relaxng          itools.workflow
  itools.handlers         itools.rest             itools.xapian
  itools.html             itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.http             itools.srx              itools.xml

The new script iodf-greek.py takes an ODF document and anonymizes it,
replacing text by 'xxx' strings, and blanking images.  This feature is
also available in the web at HForge [1].  This work has been done for
the OfficeShots [2] project, sponsored by NLnet [3].

As a side effect of the above, the translation logic of itools and
associated scripts (igettext-extract.py, igettext-build.py, etc.) has
been improved.

The ipkg-register.py and ipkg-release.py scripts have been removed.  We
are not interested anymore on them since now we are using fabric [4],
which is better suited for our deployment purposes.

Many bugs have been fixed, including #545, #666, #686, #707, #708, #709,
#710 and #711.
