itools 0.14.3 (2006/09/22)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This is mostly a bug-fix release:

 - A new datatype for time objects has been added to itools.datatypes
   (#104).

 - Now there is some support for the HTTP layer in itools.vfs, the methods
   "exists", "get_mimetype", "get_mtime", "is_file" and "is_folder" and
   "open" work.

 - An important bug in itools.catalog has been fixed, now indexing of
   stored fields when the value is a list of byte strings works fine.

 - Now the method "context.come_back" (from itools.web) accepts a URI
   object for the "goto" parameter, not just a string.

 - There have been many improvements to the calendar code, both in
   itools.ical and itools.cms: #82, #246, #496, #507 and #509.

 - Fix renaming of a non-empty folder. The external editor (itools.cms)
   works again. Text handlers have a view to change their workflow state.
   Some templates (e.g. image preview) are not broken anymore in other
   languages than english (#502, #511). And anonymous users can reach the
   profile page.
