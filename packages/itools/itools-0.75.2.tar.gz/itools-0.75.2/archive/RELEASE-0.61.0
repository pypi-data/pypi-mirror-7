itools 0.61.0 (2010/03/02)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.abnf             itools.ical             itools.srx
  itools.core             itools.log              itools.stl
  itools.csv              itools.odf              itools.tmx
  itools.datatypes        itools.office           itools.uri
  itools.fs               itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext          itools.pkg              itools.workflow
  itools.git              itools.python           itools.xapian
  itools.handlers         itools.relaxng          itools.xliff
  itools.html             itools.rest             itools.xml
  itools.http             itools.rss              itools.xmlfile
  itools.i18n             itools.soup

The new package itools.soup is a minimal wrapper around the libsoup [1]
library.  Now the itools web server is based on this library, and so the
API has considerably changed (check the documentation and the upgrade
notes to learn more).  This change improves the itools support of the
HTTP protocol.

The itools.vfs package has been renamed to itools.fs, and now includes
a local-file-system (lfs) layer proving the same API as our virtual file
system.  This change is to sensibly improve performance, particularly to
the itools.handlers database system.

The new itools.log package offers a simple logging facility.  It is
inspired by the logging mechanism available in the Glib [2] library, and
will eventually become just a wrapper.

The ipkg-install.py and ipkg-cache-list.py scripts have been removed;
now we are using "usine" [3] to automatize software deployment.  The
ipkg-build.py script should now work on Windows.

The itools.core package has seen some additions:

- the 'OrderedDict' class, for forward compatibility with Python 2.7

- the 'lazy' decorator, to make lazy properties (based on an article
  by Rick Copeland [4])

- the 'thingy_type' metaclass: an ongoing experiment to fusion classes
  & class-instances

Other minor improvements include slightly better support for the ical
file format.

Now the libsoup library is required for the itools.http and itools.web
packages.  The minimum supported versions of glib and pygobject are
now 2.20 and 2.18 respectively.  Check the upgrade notes to learn more.
