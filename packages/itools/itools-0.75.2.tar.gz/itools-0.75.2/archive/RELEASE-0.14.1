itools 0.14.1
=============

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

In spite of being a minor release, there are some important and visible
(and backwards compatible) changes.

First and foremost, the functional scope of itools.cms has been extended
with calendar objects. It is possible to create a new empty calendar or
upload ics files.

Very important too is that now the web server is gracefully stopped.
This means the pending requests will be processed before shutting down
the server.

Also, the French translation has been updated.

And of course there are a bunch of bug fixes, accross the uri, handlers,
csv, web and cms packages. This includes the task tracker items: #98,
#416, #455, #456 and #457.

Credits:
