itools 0.14.6 (2006/11/24)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

The focus of this release is performance and bug hunting. First the speed:

 - Indexing of office documents (PDF, OpenDocument, Word, etc.) has been
   massively improved in both speed and memory usage.

 - The "get_handler" and "traverse2" methods (from itools.handlers) now
   accept the optional parameter "caching"; if set to False caching won't
   be active for this call, see #569 for the details.

 - The catalog has been optimized to be about 12% faster with the index
   and unindex operations.

 - The whole module "itools.i18n.oracle" (whose purpose is to guess the
   language of a text) has been rewritten for better performance and
   readibility.

And now for the bugs:

 - A serious bug has been fixed in "itools.cms": under some conditions the
   catalog was not synchronized with the data. The issue was solved with an
   update of the catalog, but still very annoying.

 - Some bugs in itools.xhtml and itools.html have been fixed related to the
   the semi-automatic translation of (X)HTML templates and documents. And
   the unit tests have been updated. See #279 for the details.

 - Many bugs have been fixed in the itools.cms web interface: #294, #438,
   #512, #563, #576, #577, #578 and #579.
