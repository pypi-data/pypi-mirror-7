itools 0.14.2
=============

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This release brings user interface improvements and many bug fixes. These
are the most important changes:

  itools.catalog -- Fix keyword fields that are indexed but not stored,
    when there is at least one value that contains spaces. The format of
    the catalog changes a little so it must be rebuilt.

  itools.cms -- The HTML/CSS code for the tabs has been updated to work
    better in different browsers, now it even looks nice in text mode
    (#382). The web interface for calendar objects has seen various
    improvements (#82, #496).

    The configuration file and the "icms-init" script accept a new option,
    "smtp-host", which defines the host to use to send emails.

    A bunch of minor bugs have been fixed in itools.cms, including #306,
    #308, #458, #459, #460, #497, #498, #500 and #501.

  itools.csv -- The CSV parser has been separated from the CSV handler, so
    it can be used independently ("from itools.csv import parser"). Fixed
    a serious bug which prevented to create CSV handlers from scratch.

  itools.gettext -- Now the PO handler properly detects the charset defined
    in the PO files header. The family of igettext scripts has been updated
    to use the new API of itools 0.14.

  itools.xhtml -- Now the "title" attribute of (X)HTML documents is always
    extracted to be translated, not only in "img" elements. Fix corner case
    in the automatic translation code. Declare some elements as inline to
    improve the behaviour of the translation machinery.
