itools 0.50.0 (2008/12/10)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.abnf             itools.ical             itools.tmx
  itools.csv              itools.isetup           itools.uri
  itools.datatypes        itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.gettext          itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.git              itools.relaxng          itools.workflow
  itools.handlers         itools.rest             itools.xapian
  itools.html             itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.http             itools.srx              itools.xml
  itools.i18n             itools.stl

The "itools.catalog" package, which provided an index & search engine,
has been replaced by "itools.xapian".  The new package is a wrapper
around the Xapian [1] engine; it provides for backwards compatibility
the same API of "itools.catalog", only the scalability is different.

The new package "itools.isetup" provides the infrastructure required by
the new "isetup-cache-list.py", "isetup-info.py", "isetup-install.py",
"isetup-register.py" and "isetup-release.py" scripts.  Together they
make up a toolset to manage the Python packages installed in a Python
environment.

Other new packages are "itools.srx", with a partial implementation of
the "Segmentation Rules eXchange" format [2]; and "itools.relaxng",
with a partial implementation of "Relax NG" [3].  The ODF support has
been substantially improved, in particular through the use of RelaxNG.
The support of multilingual formats like PO and XLIFF has been improved
too, with new features like placeables and context handling.  These
changes have been sponsored by NLNet [4], as part of the ODF Converter
project [5].

The itools.pdf package includes the new PDF Markup Language (PML),
which renders the itools implementation of RML [6] obsolete.

The XML parser has been rewritten to provide a more complete and
accurate support of the standard.  There have been also significant
changes to the XML API, specially to the definition and handling of
namespaces.

The "itools.web" package has seen major architecture and API changes.
Almost every other package has seen API or implementation modifications
to different degrees.  Check the upgrade notes and documentation for
further details.

Now Python 2.5.2 version or later is required, Python 2.6 is supported.
See the upgrade notes for further details on what has changed.
