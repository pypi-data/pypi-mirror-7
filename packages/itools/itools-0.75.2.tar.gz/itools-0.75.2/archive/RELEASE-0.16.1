itools 0.16.1 (2007/07/05)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

This is (mostly) a bug fix release:

 - The command line tool "rsync" is not required anymore.

 - Indexing of XML documents (like web pages) works again.

 - Now itools.web supports X_FORWARDED_PROTO, what makes possible to
   deploy web applications behind Apache (or another web server) using
   the HTTPS protocol.

 - Now itools.xml is able to serialize documents with CDATA sections.

 - In itools.stl the repeat variables "repeat/x/index", "repeat/x/start"
   and "repeat/x/end" work again.

 - The method "set_handler" works now when the container is a virtual
   handler.

But most changes are in the itools.cms package:

 - The Quick Start is updated now, the "icms-make-package -t quickstart"
   command works again.

 - The new method "get_object" has been added to the itools.cms API.

 - An important bug has been fixed in the itools.cms database, where
   the incorrect usage of "mkstemp" made sometimes a transaction to
   fail because all files descriptors were used.

 - Now we correctly unindex the content of a folder when it is removed.

 - There are various fixes and improvements to the Calendar and Wiki
   objects.

 - The script "icms-update" has been improved in different ways.  Most
   important, now it is possible to upgrade an itools.cms instance
   directly from 0.14 to 0.16 (no need to go through 0.15).
