itools 0.16.8 (2007/09/06)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

Virtual hosting support has been added to the itools.web and itools.cms
packages.  From a practical point of view, it is still strongly advised
to deploy Apache or another Web Server in front of an itools Web or CMS
instance; but the rewritten rule has been vastly simplified, so the cost
of maintaining a production environment is sensibly lower.  It also
makes things easier in a development or testing environment.

Further work has been done to improve the itools experience in the
Windows platform.  Specifically the behaviour of the "icms-start.py" and
"icms-stop.py" scripts is now the same as of in a Unix-like system.

The Issue Tracker (CMS) has been extended with new features, specially
the possibility to change several bugs at once.  The forms to insert
images and links (HTML editor) are more intutive now.  And the French
translation has been updated.

Several bugs have been fixed, most notably the HTML parser now correctly
interprets elements like <li> that are missing their optional end tag.
Other packages with minor fixes are itools.vfs and itools.xml.
