itools 0.16.5 (2007/08/02)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

For compatibility with Windows, all scripts have been renamed to have
the extension ".py" (remember to clean the old ones from your install).
Also, "igettext-extract.py" works now with Windows Python files.

We have a new script called "isetup-copyright.py", it has been created
to help us to keep track of who did what and when in the code (to do so
it uses the "git blame" command).  This is the first step in a long
process to audit the code for ownership.

The "setup.conf" file supports two new variables: "source_language" and
"target_languages".  The first one allows to define a different source
language than English.  The second one allows to release only a subset
of the languages available in the "locale" folder.  (Thanks to this
little enhancement we have been able to drop the Spanish, Chinese and
Italian translations from this release, they will be back when in a
good shape.)

Support has been added for the metadata field "dc:subject" to every CMS
object.  Now the fields "dc:description" and "dc:subject" are used to
build the <meta> tags "description" and "keywords", to improve the
behaviour with search engines.  Also, the <title> tag has been fixed
for web-site objects.

The still experimental "Table" handler has earned a user interface (in
"itools.cms").

There are also user interface improvements to the tracker and the HTML
editor.  Better support for compressed files.  Locking files with the
external editor works.  And backwards compatibility fixes for the forum.

Regarding the programming interface we have a number of enhancements:

 - [itools.datatypes] Add the base class method "_get_options" to the
   Enumerate data-type, so it will be easier to define enumerate fields
   whose options are not hard-coded.
 
 - [itools.handlers] Now the "Config.get_value" method accepts the
   optional parameter "default".

 - [itools.cms] New utility function "generate_name", useful to find
   out a name that does not clashes with other names.

 - [itools.cms] Now the "OrderAware" class makes the difference beween
   ordered and not-ordered objects.  The "get_ordered_folder_names"
   method gains the optional parameter "mode" to control the information
   returned.
