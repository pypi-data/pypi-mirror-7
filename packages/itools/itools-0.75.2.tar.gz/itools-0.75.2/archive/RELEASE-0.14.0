itools 0.14.0 (alias Bolívar)
==============================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

We have choosen to name this release Bolívar, it is our little homage
to Simón Bolívar "El Libertador" [1] in the 223th anniversary of his
birthday (July 24, 1783).

This release, itools 0.14.0, brings important API and performance
improvements accross several sub-packages.

The most notably change is the new "itools.vfs" package (where "vfs"
stands for Virtual File System). It replaces the "itools.resources"
package. While functionally equivalent, "itools.vfs" offers a much
more intuitive and rich API.

Our index and search engine, the "itools.catalog" package, sports
a more compact file format. And performance for indexing, unindexing
and searching has been improved by about a 2x factor.

The API and performance of other packages has been greatly improved,
specially for "itools.handlers" and "itools.web". Also, the user
interface of "itools.cms" has been simplified, most important the
access control screens.

Last, we have raised the bar a little, since itools 0.14.0 the minimum
required version of Python is 2.5.

See the UPGRADE.txt file for more details.
