itools 0.15.5 (2007/06/01)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.csv            itools.pdf              itools.workflow
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xml
  itools.html           itools.tmx
  itools.http           itools.uri

This release has a single feature enhancement worth to comment: now
"itools.cms" indexes the content of RTF files (for this to work the
command "unrtf" must be installed).

Also important is the requiriment to run the "icms-update" script on
existing instances of "itools.cms". This will just re-index the catalog
(it is needed because of a little internal change on the "username"
field).

Still in "itools.cms", there have been a number of user interface tweaks
here and there, but most notably in the tracker.

There is a change in the "itools.catalog" API worth to comment. Now
when the method search is called without any arguments, all indexed
documents are returned.

Also, the method "get_physical_path" has been added to all handlers.
And path objects have gained the method "get_name".

Packages and scripts that have seen minor fixes and improvements are:
itools.catalog, itools.pdf, itools.web, itools.xml, isetup-build,
icms-update and icms-restore.
