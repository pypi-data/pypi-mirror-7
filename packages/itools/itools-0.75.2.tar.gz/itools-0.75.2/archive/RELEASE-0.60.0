itools 0.60.0 (2009/04/20)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.abnf             itools.i18n             itools.stl
  itools.core             itools.ical             itools.tmx
  itools.csv              itools.odf              itools.uri
  itools.datatypes        itools.pdf              itools.vfs
  itools.gettext          itools.pkg              itools.web
  itools.git              itools.relaxng          itools.workflow
  itools.handlers         itools.rest             itools.xapian
  itools.html             itools.rss              itools.xliff
  itools.http             itools.srx              itools.xml

The itools.vfs package has been rewritten to use gio, the virtual file
system from the glib project [1].  The web server (itools.web) now uses
the glib event loop.

Extracting text from office formats is in general much faster.  Command
line utilities have been replaced by libraries; for instance,  now we
use 'xlrd' [2] instead of 'xlhtml' [3] to extract text from Excel files.

Indexing text is also much faster now that itools.xapian uses the native
Xapian [4] tokenizer.  Except for Japanese and Chinese, which still use
the itools tokenizer.

The filesystem database, from itools.handlers, has been much improved:

- A read-only mode has been added, implemented by the 'RODatabase' class.

- There is a new 'GitDatabase' class that provides atomic transactions
  and versioning (using Git [5]).

- Now there is a limit to the number of file handlers that can be stored
  in the cache (defaults to five thousands).

The code has been re-arranged a little:

- The itools.isetup package has been renamed to itools.pkg, and so have
  been the related scripts: isetup-build.py renamed to ipkg-build.py,
  etc.

- There is a new itools.core package with some basic stuff, the utils.py
  module at the top level has been removed.

- There are three new packages, split from other packages: itools.python
  from itools.handlers, itools.xmlfile from itools.xml and itools.office
  from itools.xml

The implementation of RML [6] has been removed, now we promote PML
instead.

See the README file for details on the updated requirements to install
itools, and the UPGRADE-0.60.0 file for further details on what has
changed.
