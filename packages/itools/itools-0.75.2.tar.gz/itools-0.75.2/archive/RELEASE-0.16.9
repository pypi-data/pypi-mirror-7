itools 0.16.9 (2007/09/27)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

The focus of this release has been the CMS, there is one new feature,
and a lot of small user interface improvements and bug fixes.

The single new feature is for the Issue Tracker.  Now it is possible to
search issues in the tracker by multiple values (for example to find
issues of high or medium priority).

We have implemented a restful technique to handle edit conflicts.  When
two users try to modify an object at the same time, the user that changes
the object first wins, the other one will get an error message.  (For now
we apply this technique only to Web and Wiki pages.)

There is a new menu in the left column for complex objects.  For now it
works with the Wiki and the Tracker objects.

There are also many bug fixes and user interface improvements accross
the whole CMS.  Apart from "itools.cms", there have been some small
changes in the "itools.catalog", "itools.http", "itools.html" and
"itools.ical" packages.
