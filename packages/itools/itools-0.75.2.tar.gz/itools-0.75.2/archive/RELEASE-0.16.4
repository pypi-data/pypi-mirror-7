itools 0.16.4 (2007/07/26)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

For the first time in a looong time we have tested itools on Windows.
Now itools installs and the unit tests pass.

As a side effect the "vfs.move" method (from "itools.vfs") now is
cross-platform (and faster).

There is a new, and simple, handler for Gzip files (in "itools.handlers").

The document type declaration (DOCTYPE) is correctly parsed now, by
both "itools.xml" and "itools.html".  And an small bug has been fixed
in the (X)HTML sanitizer.

The CMS ("itools.cms") has a couple of enhancements.  Now emails are
sent asynchronously; if sending an email fails, it will be tried again
later.

The forum posts are now HTML instead of plain text.  The HTML editor
is used to edit the posts, and the HTML is sanitized to avoid security
problems.

There are also several fixes: in the tracker, the calendar, and when
cut&paste a document in the same folder.
