itools 0.15.3 (2007/04/06)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.http             itools.uri
  itools.cms            itools.i18n             itools.vfs
  itools.csv            itools.ical             itools.web
  itools.datatypes      itools.rss              itools.workflow
  itools.gettext        itools.schemas          itools.xhtml
  itools.handlers       itools.stl              itools.xliff
  itools.html           itools.tmx              itools.xml

This release brings some fixes and a few programing and user interface
improvements. The list of the most important changes, classified by
package, follows.

[itools.vfs] The new method "traverse" is a generator that traverses a
  folder and returns the path of every file and folder within it.

[itools.csv] Now it is possible to define a column as an internal key that
  uniquely identifies a row within the CSV file. See the type "IntegerKey"
  and the method "get_key".

[itools.ical] The search API has been reduced to methods "search_events",
  "search_events_in_date" and "search_events_in_range" (besides the more
  low-level method "search").

[itools.cms] The registration process and the user management interfaces
  have been improved. WebSite objects have gained the role "admins" (now
  we have four access levels: guest, member, reviewer and admin).

  The method "has_property" has been added to all CMS objects (it is a
  short way to call the metadata's "has_property").
