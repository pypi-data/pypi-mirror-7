itools 0.16.3 (2007/07/19)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog        itools.i18n             itools.tmx
  itools.cms            itools.ical             itools.uri
  itools.csv            itools.odf              itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes      itools.pdf              itools.web
  itools.gettext        itools.rest             itools.workflow
  itools.handlers       itools.rss              itools.xhtml
  itools.html           itools.schemas          itools.xliff
  itools.http           itools.stl              itools.xml

Version 0.16.3 of itools does not use anymore the package uTidylib [1]
(it was required by itools.cms), now the itools API for (X)HTML is used
instead.

But the big news this Thursday is the new file handler (named "Table")
to manage structured data.  This feature is still in an experimental
state, the API will probably change in the next releases.

Another important change, the Virtual File System (itools.vfs) now can
open files in "append" mode.  This is supported by the local file system
layer, and by the itools.cms database.  So far only the handler Table
takes advantage of this feature to improve scalability.

All handlers have a new method, "abort_changes", which will reset the
changes made to a handler and not yet saved.  Folders have an specific
implementation that improves memory usage when a transaction is aborted,
or fails.

The itools.xhtml package has two new functions, "sanitize_stream" and
"sanitize_str"; they will clean an (X)HTML fragment of potentially
dangerous elements and attributes, like JavaScript code.

The (X)HTML document handlers have two new methods: "to_xhtml" and
"to_html".  They return a byte string that represents the state of the
handler, as XHTML and HTML respectively.

The HTML parser is now compatible with the XML parser, the events it
returns have the same structure.  And the state of the HTML document
handler is now identical to the state of the XHTML document handler.
(This way the itools.xhtml and itools.html packages are getting closer,
in preparation for a future merge.)

There is a fix in the XML parser (itools.xml), it did not correctly
parse attribute values when there was more than one entity reference.

And another small fix in the "set_prefix" function from itools.stl, now
the "<a>" tags are also processed.

The reST support (itools.rest) has seen some changes to the API.  First
the function "to_html_events" will return an stream of (X)HTML events
from a reST text.  Second the new function "to_str(text, format)" is
recommended over "to_xml", "to_html" and "to_latex", which become
deprecated.  Last, the "Document" class has been removed, as it was
redundant (use the functions instead).

And the usual bunch of fixes for itools.cms; most notably the new
procedure for when the user forgets her password: now instead of
sending a new password by email we send a link to a form that allows
the user to choose her new password.  Also, a number of methods
have been deprecated, check the UPDATE-0.16.3 file for the details.
