        ##############
        
        check_puppetdb_node is a Nagios / Icinga plugin that allows you to check the
        agent/run status by querying PuppetDB. This is more robust and reliable
        than parsing the report YAML that the agent might store on disk.
        
        This plugin requires:
            * `pypuppetdb`_
        
        .. _pypuppetdb: https://github.com/nedap/pypuppetdb
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install this package from source or from PyPi.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install check_puppetdb_node
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/daenney/check_puppetdb_node
           $ pip install .
        
        If you wish to hack on this, clone the repository as above but instead run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install -e .
        
        
        Usage
