Poio API
========
Poio API is a free and open source Python library to access and search data from
language documentation in your linguistic analysis workflow. It converts file
formats like Elan's EAF, Toolbox files, Typecraft XML and others into annotation
graphs as defined in ISO 24612. Those graphs, for which we use an implementation
called "Graph Annotation Framework" (GrAF), allow unified access to linguistic
data from a wide range sources.
