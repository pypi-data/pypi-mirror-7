Querying
========

For the examples in this chapter, I'll be assuming that you've loaded your
server up with the books data supplied with the example Solr setup.

The data itself you can see at
``$SOLR_SOURCE_DIR/example/exampledocs/books.json``.  To load it into a server
running with the example schema:

::

    $ cd example/exampledocs
    $ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/update/json?commit=true' --data-binary \
    @exampledocs/books.json -H 'Content-type:application/json'

Searching solr
--------------

Scorched uses a chaining API, and will hopefully look quite familiar to anyone
who has used the Django ORM.

The ``books.json`` data looked like this::

    [
        {
            "id" : "978-0641723445",
            "cat" : ["book","hardcover"],
            "name" : "The Lightning Thief",
            "author" : "Rick Riordan",
            "series_t" : "Percy Jackson and the Olympians",
            "sequence_i" : 1,
            "genre_s" : "fantasy",
            "inStock" : true,
            "price" : 12.50,
            "pages_i" : 384
        }
    ...
    ]

.. note:: Dynamic fields.

    Dynamic fields are named with a suffix (*_i, *_t, *_s).

A simple search for one word, in the default search field.

::

    >>> si.query("thief")

Maybe you want to search in the (non-default) field author for authors called
Martin

::

    >>> si.query(author="rick")

Maybe you want to search for books with "thief" in their title, by an author
called "rick".

::

    >>> si.query(name="thief", author="rick")

Perhaps your initial, default, search is more complex, and has more than one
word in it:

::

    >>> si.query(name="lightning").query(name="thief")

A easy way to see what sunburnt is producing is to call ``options``::

    >>> si.query(name="lightning").query(name="thief").options()
    {'q': u'name:lightning AND name:thief'}

Executing queries
-----------------------------------------------

Scorched is lazy in constructing queries. The examples in the previous section
don’t actually perform the query - they just create a "query object" with the
correct parameters. To actually get the results of the query, you’ll need to
execute it:

::

    >>> response = si.query("thief").execute()

This will return a ``SolrResponse`` object. If you treat this object as a list,
then each member of the list will be a document, in the form of a Python
dictionary containing the relevant fields:

For example, if you run the first example query above, you should see a
response like this:

::

    >>> for result in si.query("thief").execute():
    ...    print result
    {
        u'name': u'The Lightning Thief', 
        u'author': u'Rick Riordan', 
        u'series_t': u'Percy Jackson and the Olympians', 
        u'pages_i': 384, 
        u'genre_s': u'fantasy', 
        u'author_s': u'Rick Riordan', 
        u'price': 12.5, 
        u'price_c': u'12.5,USD', 
        u'sequence_i': 1, 
        u'inStock': True, 
        u'_version_': 1462820023761371136, 
        u'cat': [u'book', u'hardcover'], 
        u'id': u'978-0641723445'
    }

Of course, often you don’t want your results in the form of a dictionary,
you want an object.  Perhaps you have the following class defined in your code:

::

    >>> class Book:
    ...     def __init__(self, name, author, **other_kwargs):
    ...         self.title = name
    ...         self.author = author
    ...         self.other_kwargs = other_kwargs
    ... 
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return 'Book("%s", "%s")' % (self.title, self.author)


You can tell scorched to give you ``Book`` instances back by telling
``execute()`` to use the class as a constructor.

::

    >>> for result in si.query("game").execute(constructor=Book):
    ...     print result
    Book("The Lightning Thief", "Rick Riordan")

The ``constructor`` argument most often will be a class, but it can be any
callable; it will always be called as ``constructor(**response_dict)``.


You can extract more information from the response than simply the list of
results. The SolrResponse object has the following attributes:

* ``response.status`` : status of query. (status != 0 something went wrong).
* ``response.QTime`` : how long did the query take in milliseconds.
* ``response.params`` : the params that were used in the query.

and the results themselves are in the following attributes

* ``response.result`` : the results of your main query.
* ``response.result.groups`` : see `Result greater`_ below.
* ``response.facet_counts`` : see `Faceting`_ below.
* ``response.highlighting`` : see `Highlighting`_ below.
* ``response.more_like_these`` : see `More Like This`_ below.

Finally, ``response.result`` itself has the following attributes

* ``response.result.numFound`` : total number of docs found in the index.
* ``response.result.docs`` : the actual results themselves.
* ``response.result.start`` : if the number of docs is less than numFound,
                              then this is the pagination offset. 

Pagination
----------

By default, Solr will only return the first 10 results (this is configurable in
``schema.xml``). To get at more results, you need to tell solr to paginate
further through the results. You do this by applying the ``paginate()`` method,
which takes two parameters, ``start`` and ``rows``:

::

    >>> si.query("black").paginate(start=10, rows=30)

Returning different fields
--------------------------

By default, Solr will return all stored fields in the results. You might only
be interested in a subset of those fields. To restrict the fields Solr returns,
you apply the ``field_limit()`` methods.

::

    >>> si.query("game").field_limit("id")
    >>> si.query("game").field_limit(["id", "name"])

You can use the same option to get hold of the relevancy score that Solr
has calculated for each document in the query:

::

    >>> si.query("game").field_limit(score=True) # Return the score alongside each document
    >>> si.query("game").field_limit("id", score=True") # return just the id and score.

The results appear just like the normal dictionary responses, but with a different
selection of fields.

::

    >>> for result in si.query("thief").field_limit("id", score=True"):
    ...     print result
    {u'score': 0.6349302, u'id': u'978-0641723445'}

More complex queries
--------------------

In our books example, there are two numerical fields - the ``price`` (which is
a float) and ``sequence_i`` (which is an integer).  Numerical fields can be
queried:

* exactly
* by comparison (``<`` / ``<=`` / ``>=`` / ``>``)
* by range (between two values)

Exact queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't try and query floats exactly unless you really know what you're doing
(http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html). Solr
will let you, but you almost certainly don't want to. Querying integers exactly
is fine though.

::

    >>> si.query(sequence_i=1)

Comparison queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These use a new syntax:

::

    >>> si.query(price__lt=7)

Notice the double-underscore separating "price" from "lt". It will search for
all books whose price is less than 7. You can do similar searches on any float
or integer field, and you can use:

* ``gt`` : greater than, ``>``
* ``gte`` : greater than or equal to, ``>=``
* ``lt`` : less than, ``<``
* ``lte`` : less than or equal to, ``<=``

Range queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an extension of a comparison query, you can query for values that are within
a range, ie between two different numbers.

::

    >>> si.query(price__range=(5, 7)) # all books with prices between 5 and 7.

This range query is *inclusive* - it will return prices of books which are
priced at exactly 5 or exactly 7. You can also make an *exclusive* search:

::

    >>> si.query(price__rangeexc=(5, 7))

Which will exclude books priced at exactly 5 or 7.

Finally, you can also do a completely open range search:

::

    >>> si.query(price__any=True)

Will search for a book which has *any* price. Why would you do this? Well, if
you had a schema where price was *optional*, then this search would return all
books which had a price - and exclude any books which didn’t have a price.

Date queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query on dates the same way as you can query on numbers: exactly, by
comparison, or by range.

Be warned, though, that exact searching on date suffers from similar problems
to exact searching on floating point numbers. Solr stores all dates to
microsecond precision; exact searching will fail unless the date requested is
also correct to microsecond precision.

::

    >>> si.query(date_dt=datetime.datetime(2006, 02, 13))

Will search for items whose manufacture date is *exactly* zero microseconds
after midnight on the 13th February, 2006.

More likely you'll want to search by comparison or by range:

::

    # all items after the 1st January 2006
    >>> si.query(date_dt__gt=datetime.datetime(2006, 1, 1))

    # all items in Q1 2006.
    >>> si.query(date_dt__range=(datetime.datetime(2006, 1, 1), datetime.datetime(2006, 4, 1))

The argument to a date query can be any object that looks roughly like a Python
``datetime`` object or a string in W3C Datetime notation
(http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)

::

    >>> si.query(date_dt__gte="2006")
    >>> si.query(date_dt__lt="2009-04-13")
    >>> si.query(date_dt__range=("2010-03-04 00:34:21", "2011-02-17 09:21:44"))

Boolean fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boolean fields are flags on a document. In the example hardware specs,
documents carry an ``inStock`` field. We can select on that by doing:

::

    >>> si.query("thief", inStock=True)


Sorting results
---------------

Solr will return results in "relevancy" order. How Solr determines relevancy is
a complex question, and can depend highly on your specific setup. However, it’s
possible to override this and sort query results by another field. This field
must be sortable, so most likely your'’d use a numerical or date field.

::

    >>> si.query("thief").sort_by("price") # ascending price
    >>> si.query("thief").sort_by("-price") # descending price

You can also sort on multiple factors:

::

    >>> si.query("thief").sort_by("-price").sort_by("score")

This query will sort first by descending price, and then by increasing "score"
(which is what solr calls relevancy).


Complex queries
---------------

Scorched queries can be chained together in all sorts of ways, with
query terms being applied.

What we do is construct two *query objects*, one for each condition, and ``OR``
them together.

::

    >>> si.query(si.Q("thief") | si.Q("sea"))

The ``Q`` object can contain an arbitrary query, and can then be combined using
Boolean logic (here, using ``|``, the OR operator). The result can then be
passed to a normal ``si.query()`` call for execution.

``Q`` objects can be combined using any of the Boolean operators, so
also ``&`` (``AND``) and ``~`` (``NOT``), and can be nested within each
other.

A moderately complex query could be written:

::

    >>> query = si.query(si.Q(si.Q("thief") & ~si.Q(author="ostein")) \
    | si.Q(si.Q("foo") & ~si.Q(author="bui")))

Which will producse this query:

::

    >>> query.options()
    {'q': u'(thief AND (*:* AND NOT author:ostein)) OR (foo AND (*:* AND NOT author:bui))'}


Excluding results from queries
------------------------------

If we want to *exclude* results by some criteria we use the ``~si.Q()``.

::

    >>> si.query(~si.Q(author="Rick Riordan"))


Wildcard searching
------------------

You can use asterisks and question marks in the normal way, except that you may
not use leading wildcards - ie no wildcards at the beginning of a term.

Search for book with "thie" in the name:

::

    >>> si.query(name=scorched.strings.WildcardString("thie*"))

If, for some reason, you want to search exactly for a string with an asterisk
or a question mark in it then you need to tell Solr to special case it:

::

    >>> si.query(id=RawString("055323933?*"))

This will search for a document whose id contains *exactly* the string given,
including the question mark and asterisk.


Filter queries
--------------

Solr implements several internal caching layers, and to some extent you can
control when and how they're used.

Often, you find that you can partition your query; one part is run many times
without change, or with very limited change, and another part varies much more.
(See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/FilterQueryGuidance for more guidance.)

If you taking search input from the user, you would write:

::

    >>> si.query(name=user_input).filter(price__lt=7.5)
    >>> si.query(name=user_input).filter(price__gte=7.5)

Adding multiple filter::

    >>> si.query(name="bla").filter(price__lt=7.5).filter(author="hans").options()
    {'fq': [u'author:hans', u'price:{* TO 7.5}'], 'q': u'name:bla'}

    
You can filter any sort of query, simply by using ``filter()`` instead of
``query()``. And if your filtering involves an exclusion, then simple use
``~si.Q(author="lloyd")``.

::

    >>> si.query(title="black").filter(~si.Q(author="lloyd")).options()
    {'fq': u'NOT author:lloyd', 'q': u'title:black'}

It's possible to mix and match ``query()`` and ``filter()`` calls as much as
you like while chaining. The resulting filter queries will be combined and
cached together. The argument to a ``filter()`` call can be an combination of
``si.Q`` objects.

::

    >>> si.query(title="black").filter(
    ...     si.Q(si.Q(name="thief") & ~si.Q(author="ostein"))
    ...         ).filter(si.Q(si.Q(title="foo") & ~si.Q(author="bui"))
    ... ).options()
    {'fq': [u'name:thief', u'title:foo', u'NOT author:ostein', u'NOT author:bui'],
     'q': u'title:black'}

Boosting
---------

Solr provides a mechanism for "boosting" results according to the values of
various fields (See
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRelevancyCookbook#Boosting_Ranking_Terms for a
full explanation).


Boosts the importance of the author field by 3.

::

    >>> si.query(si.Q("black") | si.Q(author="lloyd")**3).options()
    {'q': u'black OR author:lloyd^3'}


A more common pattern is that you want all books with "black" in the title *and
you have a preference for those authored by Lloyd Alexander*. This is different
from the last query; the last query would return books by Lloyd Alexander which
did not have "black" in the title. Achieving this in solr is possible, but a
little awkward; scorched provides a shortcut for this pattern.

::

    >>> si.query("black").boost_relevancy(3, author_t="lloyd").options()
    {'q': u'black OR (black AND author_t:lloyd^3)'}

This is fully chainable, and ``boost_relevancy`` can take an arbitrary
collection of query objects.

Faceting
--------

For background, see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SimpleFacetParameters.

Scorched lets you apply faceting to any query, with the ``facet_by()`` method,
chainable on a query object. The ``facet_by()`` method needs, at least, a field
(or list of fields) to facet on:

::

    >>> facet_query = si.query("thief").facet_by("sequence_i").paginate(rows=0)

The above fragment will search for game with "thrones" in the title, and facet
the results according to the value of ``sequence_i``. It will also return zero
results, just the facet output.

::

    >>> print facet_query.execute().facet_counts.facet_fields
    {u'sequence_i': [(u'1', 1), (u'2', 0)]}

The ``facet_counts`` objects contains several sets of results - here, we're
only interested in the ``facet_fields`` object. This contains a dictionary of
results, keyed by each field where faceting was requested. The dictionary value
is a list of two-tuples, mapping the value of the faceted field.

You can facet on more than one field at a time:

:: 

    >>> si.query(...).facet_by(fields=["field1", "field2, ...])

The ``facet_fields`` dictionary will have more than one key.

Solr supports a number of parameters to the faceting operation. All of the
basic options are exposed through scorched:

::

    fields, prefix, sort, limit, offset, mincount, missing, method,
    enum.cache.minDf

All of these can be used as keyword arguments to the ``facet()`` call, except
of course the last one since it contains periods. To pass keyword arguments
with periods in them, you can use `**` syntax:

::

    >>> facet(**{"enum.cache.minDf":25})

You can also facet on the result of one or more queries, using the
``facet_query()`` method. For example:

::

    >>> fquery = si.query("game").facet_query(price__lt=7).facet_query(price__gte=7)
    >>> print fquery.execute().facet_counts.facet_queries
    [('price:[7.0 TO *]', 1), ('price:{* TO 7.0}', 1)]

This will facet the results according to the two queries specified, so you can
see how many of the results cost less than 7, and how many cost more.

The results come back this time in the ``facet_queries`` object, but have the
same form as before. The facets are shown as a list of tuples, mapping query
to number of results.

Result grouping
---------------

For background, see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/FieldCollapsing.

Solr 3.3 added support for result grouping.

A example call lookes like this:

::

    >>> resp = si.query().group_by('genre_s', limit=10).execute()
    >>> for g in resp.groups['genre_s']['groups']:
    ...     print "%s #%s" % (g['groupValue'], len(g['doclist']['docs']))
    ...     for d in  g['doclist']['docs']:
    ...         print "\t%s" % d['name']
    fantasy #3
        The Lightning Thief
        The Sea of Monsters
        Sophie's World : The Greek Philosophers
    IT #1
        Lucene in Action, Second Edition

Highlighting
------------

For background, see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/HighlightingParameters.

Alongside the normal search results, you can ask solr to return fragments of
the documents, with relevant search terms highlighted. You do this with the
chainable ``highlight()`` method.

Specify which field we would like to see highlighted:

::

    >>> resp = si.query('thief').highlight('name').execute()
    >>> resp.highlighting
    {u'978-0641723445': {u'name': [u'The Lightning <em>Thief</em>']}}

It is also possible to specify a array of fields::
    
    >>> si.query('thief').highlight(['name', 'title']).options()
    {'hl': True, 'hl.fl': 'name,title', 'q': u'thief'}

PostingsHighlighter
-------------------

For background, see https://wiki.apache.org/solr/PostingsHighlighter.

PostingsHighlighter is a new highlighter in Solr4.3 to summarize documents
for summary results. You do this with the
chainable ``postings_highlight()`` method.

Specify which field we would like to see highlighted:

::

    >>> resp = si.query('thief').postings_highlight('name').execute()
    >>> resp.highlighting
    {u'978-0641723445': {u'name': [u'The Lightning <em>Thief</em>']}}

It is also possible to specify a array of fields::
    
    >>> si.query('thief').postings_highlight(['name', 'title']).options()
    {'hl': True, 'hl.fl': 'name,title', 'q': u'thief'}


More Like This
--------------

For background, see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/MoreLikeThis. Alongside a set
of search results, Solr can suggest other documents that are similar to each of
the documents in the search result.

More-like-this searches are accomplished with the ``mlt()`` chainable option.
Solr needs to know which fields to consider when deciding similarity.

::

    >>> resp = si.query(id="978-0641723445").mlt("genre_s", mintf=1, mindf=1).execute()
    >>> resp.more_like_these
    {u'978-0641723445': <scorched.response.SolrResult at 0x28b6350>}

    >>> resp.more_like_these['978-0641723445'].docs
    [{u'_version_': 1462820023772905472,
      u'author': u'Rick Riordan',
      u'author_s': u'Rick Riordan',
      u'cat': [u'book', u'paperback'],
      u'genre_s': u'fantasy',
      u'id': u'978-1423103349',
      u'inStock': True,
      u'name': u'The Sea of Monsters',
      u'pages_i': 304,
      u'price': 6.49,
      u'price_c': u'6.49,USD',
      u'sequence_i': 2,
      u'series_t': u'Percy Jackson and the Olympians'},
     {u'_version_': 1462820023776051200,
      u'author': u'Jostein Gaarder',
      u'author_s': u'Jostein Gaarder',
      u'cat': [u'book', u'paperback'],
      u'genre_s': u'fantasy',
      u'id': u'978-1857995879',
      u'inStock': True,
      u'name': u"Sophie's World : The Greek Philosophers",
      u'pages_i': 64,
      u'price': 3.07,
      u'price_c': u'3.07,USD',
      u'sequence_i': 1}]

Here we used ``mlt()`` options to alter the default behaviour (because our
corpus is so small that Solr wouldn't find any similar documents with the
standard behaviour.

The ``SolrResponse`` object has a ``more_like_these`` attribute. This is a
dictionary of ``SolrResult`` objects, one dictionary entry for each result of
the main query. Here, the query only produced one result (because we searched
on the ``uniqueKey``. Inspecting the ``SolrResult`` object, we find that it
contains only one document.

We can read the above result as saying that under the ``mlt()`` parameters
requested, there was only one document similar to the search result.

To avoid having to do the extra dictionary lookup.

``mlt()`` also takes a list of options (see the Solr documentation for a full explanation);

::

    fields, count, mintf, mindf, minwl, mawl, maxqt, maxntp, boost


Alternativ parser
-----------------

Scorched support the `dismax` and `edismax` parser. This can be added by simply
calling ``alt_parser``.

Example::

    >>> si.query().alt_parser('edismax', mm=2).options()
    {'defType': 'edismax', 'mm': 2, 'q': '*:*'}

Set request handler
-------------------

For background, see https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler.
It is possible to set the request handler. To set a different request handler
use ``set_requesthandler``.

Example::
    
    >>> si.query().set_requesthandler('foo').options()
    {u'q': u'*:*', u'qt': 'foo'}

Set debug
---------

For background, see https://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#Debugging.
To get see what solr is doing with our query we need sometimes more info. To get
this addition information we set ``debug``.

Example::
    
    >>> si.query().debug().options()
    {u'debugQuery': True, u'q': u'*:*'}
    >>>  si.query().debug().execute().debug
    {u'QParser': u'LuceneQParser',
    u'explain': {u'978-1423103349': u'\n1.0 = (MATCH) MatchAllDocsQuery, product of:\n  1.0 = queryNorm\n',
     u'978-1857995879': u'\n1.0 = (MATCH) MatchAllDocsQuery, product of:\n  1.0 = queryNorm\n',
     u'978-1933988177': u'\n1.0 = (MATCH) MatchAllDocsQuery, product of:\n  1.0 = queryNorm\n'},
