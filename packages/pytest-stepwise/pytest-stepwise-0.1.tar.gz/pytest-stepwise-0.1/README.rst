Introduction
============

pytest-stepwise is a plugin for `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_ that run all tests until a test fails, and then continue next test run from where the last run failed. You may think of it as a combination of the  `-x` option, which exits the test run after a failing test, and the `--lf` option from `pytest-cache`, which only runs failing tests. 

pytest-stepwise depends on pytest-cache, which will be installed by pip.


How to use it?
==============

1. Run ``py.test --stepwise``.
2. Watch the test fail and fix it.
3. Again, run ``py.test --stepwise``. The test suite will continue to run from right where it was.
