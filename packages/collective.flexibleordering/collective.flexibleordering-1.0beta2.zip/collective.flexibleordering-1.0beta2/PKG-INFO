Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        This product provides a couple IOrdering adpaters to provide efficient
        auto-sorting of folders with significant amounts of content.
        
        It includes a title (``flexible-title-ordering``) and id
        (``flexible-id-ordering``) ordering, but is intended to allow easy
        creation of custom sorts.
        
        It is easy to create custom ordering implementations by subclassing
        one of the included implementations and simply overriding the
        ``key_func(obj)`` method which generates a sort key for contained
        content.  Essentially, any ordering can be achieved in this manner.
        
        Note: The full data structure containing the folder order key -> id
        mapping is stored on the folder itself.  This means that folder
        instances with a large amount of content may become somewhat large,
        but that order lookups should be quite fast.
