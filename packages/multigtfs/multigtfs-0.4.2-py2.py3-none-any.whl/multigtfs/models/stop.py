Define Stop model for rows in stops.txt

Google documentation from
https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference

stops.txt is required

- stop_id (required)
The stop_id field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a stop or station.
Multiple routes may use the same stop. The stop_id is dataset unique.

- stop_code (optional)
The stop_code field contains short text or a number that uniquely identifies
the stop for passengers. Stop codes are often used in phone-based transit
information systems or printed on stop signage to make it easier for riders to
get a stop schedule or real-time arrival information for a particular stop.

The stop_code field should only be used for stop codes that are displayed to
passengers. For internal codes, use stop_id. This field should be left blank
for stops without a code.

- stop_name (required)
The stop_name field contains the name of a stop or station. Please use a name
that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular.

- stop_desc (optional)
The stop_desc field contains a description of a stop. Please provide useful,
quality information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the stop.

- stop_lat (required)
The stop_lat field contains the latitude of a stop or station. The field value
must be a valid WGS 84 latitude.

- stop_lon (required)
The stop_lon field contains the longitude of a stop or station. The field value
must be a valid WGS 84 longitude value from -180 to 180.

- zone_id (optional)
The zone_id field defines the fare zone for a stop ID. Zone IDs are required if
you want to provide fare information using fare_rules.txt. If this stop ID
represents a station, the zone ID is ignored.

- stop_url (optional)
The stop_url field contains the URL of a web page about a particular stop. This
should be different from the agency_url and the route_url fields.

The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and
any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See
  http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html
for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.

- location_type (optional)
The location_type field identifies whether this stop ID represents a stop or
station. If no location type is specified, or the location_type is blank, stop
IDs are treated as stops. Stations may have different properties from stops
when they are represented on a map or used in trip planning.

The location type field can have the following values:

    * 0 or blank - Stop. A location where passengers board or disembark from a
        transit vehicle.
    * 1 - Station. A physical structure or area that contains one or more stop.

- parent_station (optional)
For stops that are physically located inside stations, the parent_station field
identifies the station associated with the stop. To use this field, stops.txt
must also contain a row where this stop ID is assigned location type=1.

If this stop ID represents a stop located inside a station, this entry's
location type should be 0 or blank, and the entry's parent_station field
contains the stop ID of the station where this stop is located. The stop
referenced by parent_station must have location_type=1.

If this stop ID represents a stop located outside a station, this entry's
location type should be 0 or blank, and the entry's parent_station field
contains a blank value. The parent_station field doesn't apply to this stop.

If this stop ID represents a station, this entry's location type should be 1,
and the entry's parent_station field should be a blank value. Stations can't
contain other stations.

- stop_timezone (optional)
The stop_timezone field contains the timezone in which this stop or station is
located. Please refer to Wikipedia List of Timezones for a list of valid
values:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones

If omitted, the stop should be assumed to be located in the timezone specified
by agency_timezone in agency.txt.

When a stop has a parent station, the stop is considered to be in the timezone
specified by the parent station's stop_timezone value. If the parent has no
stop_timezone value, the stops that belong to that station are assumed to be in
the timezone specified by agency_timezone, even if the stops have their own
stop_timezone values. In other words, if a given stop has a parent_station
value, any stop_timezone value specified for that stop must be ignored.

Even if stop_timezone values are provided in stops.txt, the times in
stop_times.txt should continue to be specified as time since midnight in the
timezone specified by agency_timezone in agency.txt. This ensures that the time
values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which
timezones the trip crosses.

- wheelchair_boarding (optional)
The wheelchair_boarding field identifies whether wheelchair boardings are
possible from the specified stop or station. The field can have the following
values:

    * 0 (or empty) - indicates that there is no accessibility information for
        the stop
    * 1 - indicates that at least some vehicles at this stop can be boarded
        by a rider in a wheelchair
    * 2 - wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop

When a stop is part of a larger station complex, as indicated by a stop with a
parent_station value, the stop's wheelchair_boarding field has the following
additional semantics:

    * 0 (or empty) - the stop will inherit its wheelchair_boarding value from
        the parent station, if specified in the parent
    * 1 - there exists some accessible path from outside the station to the
        specific stop / platform
    * 2 - there exists no accessible path from outside the station to the
        specific stop / platform
