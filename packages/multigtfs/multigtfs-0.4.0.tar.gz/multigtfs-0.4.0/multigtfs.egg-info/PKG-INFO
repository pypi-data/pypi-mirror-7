Description: multigtfs: GTFS as a Django app
        ===============================
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/tulsawebdevs/django-multi-gtfs.svg?branch=master
            :target: https://travis-ci.org/tulsawebdevs/django-multi-gtfs
        
        **multigtfs** is an `Apache 2.0`_-licensed Django app that supports importing
        and exporting of GTFS feeds.  All features of the `June 20, 2012 reference`_
        are supported, including `all changes`_ up to February 17, 2014.
        It allows multiple feeds to be stored in the database at once.
        
        It requires a spatial databases compatible with GeoDjango_.  PostgreSQL_ 9.x
        and PostGIS_ 2.x are recommended for development and production, since these
        support all the GeoDjango features.  There are issues with GeoDjango in
        Django 1.4 (see issue `20036`_), so Django 1.5 or above is recommended.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Installation
        ++++++++++++
        1. ``pip install multigtfs``
        2. In your settings, add ``multigtfs`` to your ``INSTALLED APPS`` and ensure
           you have a spatial database configured.
        3. ``./manage.py syncdb`` to install the tables, or ``./manage.py migrate`` if
           you are using South_
        
        Management Commands
        +++++++++++++++++++
        There are two management commands to get GTFS feeds in and out of the database:
        
        ::
        
            ./manage.py importgtfs [--name name_of_feed] path/to/gtfsfeed.zip
            ./manage.py exportgtfs [--name basename_of_file] <feed_id>
        
        A third command will update cached geometries, used for making geo-queries at
        the shape, trip, or route level:
        
        ::
        
            ./manage.py refreshgeometries --all   # Refresh all geometries
            ./manage.py refreshgeometries 1 2 3   # Refresh just feeds 1, 2, and 3
        
        *Note*: cached geometries are normally updated whenever the related shape
        points or stops are updated.  This command is useful for refreshing geometries
        after manual changes or after a bug fix (like the v0.3.3 update).
        
        In Code
        +++++++
        multigtfs is composed of Django models that implement GTFS, plus helper
        methods for importing and exporting to the GTFS format.  Where GTFS relates
        objects through IDs (such as Stop IDs for stops), multigtfs uses
        ForeignKeys.
        
        multigtfs includes a Feed object, which is not part of GTFS.  This is used
        to include several feeds in the same file without collisions.  These can be
        feeds from different agencies, or different versions of a feed from the same
        agency.  The object has a helper method, ``in_feed``, that is sometimes useful
        in filtering objects by feed.  At other times, it is easier to start at the
        feed and follow relations.
        
        There isn't separate documentation yet.  Load the app in your Django project,
        play with the admin, and read the source code to learn more.
        
        Sample Project
        ++++++++++++++
        The `examples/explore` sample project demonstrates a simple read-only website
        for viewing one or more GTFS feeds.  It include OpenLayers_ maps for viewing
        the routes, trips, and shapes.  You an use it as is, or as a starting place
        for your own projects.  See the project README for more information.
        
        Project History
        ---------------
        multigtfs was first developed for the `Tulsa Web Devs`_' project to get
        Tulsa's buses into `Google Maps`_.  `tulsa-transit-google`_ is the
        Tulsa-specific portion, and multigtfs contains the parts useful for any
        GTFS effort.  `Tulsa's bus schedule appeared on
        Google Maps in July 2013`_, after a two-year effort.  The Tulsa Web Devs
        founded `Code for Tulsa`_ to collaborate on future civic tech projects.
        
        Several features, including GeoDjango_ support and much faster feed imports,
        were generously sponsored by MRCagney_.
        
        Future
        ------
        Upcoming features include:
        
        - Validating the feed against Google's requirements
        - More documentation
        
        See the `issues list`_ for more details.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.4.0 (2014-06-21)
        ------------------
        This release was generously sponsored by MRCagney.
        
        * Import and export are 17-21x faster.  Very large feeds (~20MB) can now be
          imported and exported without running out of memory (4 GB of RAM
          recommended).  When running management commands, increasing verbosity
          ('-v 1' or -v 2') will print useful status messages.
        * Additional columns not in the current GTFS spec are now imported into
          'extra_data', a new JSON field.  The columns are noted in the Feed's new
          JSON field, 'meta'.  These addition items appear in the example project,
          and are exported after standard columns in the exported feed.
        * Added Python 3 compatibility
        * Extend more fields for real-world data (Trip.short_name,
          Zone.zone_id, and Block.block_id)
        * On import, if two rows have duplicate unique ID (trip_id, stop_id, etc.),
          then only the first will be imported.  A warning will printed to stderr.
          Previously, both may have been imported, with unknown consequences.
        * Dropped support for South 0.7.x (not Python 3 compatible)
        * Trips now have a single Service.  Extra services will be detected by
          migration 0018, and will have to be manually removed.
        
        0.3.3 (2014-03-28)
        ------------------
        * Add new optional fields (issue #23):
            - trip.wheelchair_accessible
            - trip.bikes_allowed
            - stop.wheelchair_boarding
        * Route.geometry does not include duplicate Trip.geometry lines (issue #24)
        * Fix order of points in Shape.geometry (issue #25)
        * Add management command 'refreshgeometries' to refresh cached geometries
          (useful if you were impacted by issues #24 or #25)
        
        0.3.2 (2014-03-16)
        ------------------
        This release was generously sponsored by MRCagney.
        
        * Fix migration 0007 for PostGIS (issue #22)
        
        0.3.1 (2014-03-12)
        ------------------
        This release was generously sponsored by MRCagney.
        
        * Add example project 'explore', which represents a feed as linked pages with
          OpenLayer maps.
        * Add cached geometry for Routes, Trips, and Shapes.
        * Extend fields for real-world data (FeedInfo.version, Route.short_name).
        * Drop support for Points as geography fields.
        
        0.3.0 (2014-02-01)
        ------------------
        This release was generously sponsored by MRCagney.
        
        * Convert to GeoDjango: Stops and ShapePoints use Points rather than lat/long,
          admin shows map of points, and new configuration settings to customize.
        * Import south in try/except blocks (so that South really is optional).
        * Django 1.5 or above is now required.
        
        0.2.6 (2013-06-07)
        ------------------
        * Remove verify_exists from URLField, so it can be used in Django 1.5
        
        0.2.5 (2013-02-13)
        ------------------
        * Human-friendly sorting for rest of GTFS output
        
        0.2.4 (2013-02-06)
        ------------------
        * Added optional manual sorting of output, used on stop_times.txt
        
        0.2.3 (2012-11-09)
        ------------------
        * Added South migrations for applying 0.2.2 changes
        
        0.2.2 (2012-11-09)
        ------------------
        * Fixed Fare.transfers for unlimited rides (use None instead of -1)
        * First PyPi version
