GTFS test data from:

test1.zip - http://timetablepublisher.googlecode.com/files/GTFS%20Test%20Data.zip downloaded on Apr 14th, 2012
test2.zip - https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/examples/sample-feed.zip on Apr 14th, 2012
test3.zip - http://www.tulsatransit.org/gtfs/google_transit.zip, around Feb 2013

test1.zip doesn't pass validation, because of the directory structure.  It
has multiple trip_ids, assigned to different service_ids.  multigtfs will
import the feed, and (as of v0.4.0) will discard the duplicate trip IDs
with a warning.

test2.zip has some validation issues as well, with a mispelled column name
(drop_off_time vs drop_off_type) and inconsistant commas.  multigtfs will
import the feed, and (as of v0.4.0) will import the drop_off_type as an
unknown extra column.

test3.zip is a minimized version of an official feed.  The only validation
error is that the last service date is in the past.  multigtfs will
import and export the feed with no changes.
