Description: Intro
        =====
        
        Ever get your SO/ hot date/ that bartender that kinda looks like Ryan
        Gosling back to your place and when you go to put on some sweet jams for
        a long night of ~~awkward hip convulsions~~ sexy fun times only to have
        the mood somewhat dampened by the time it takes to open up your browser,
        find a playlist and then click play? Enter Get Lucky.
        
        Get Lucky is a command line interface that uses Songza to quickly set
        the mood.

        ### Getting Lucky
        
        When it gets hot and heavy, whether you need some sound cover so your
        roommate doesn't bust into your room concerned that you're torturing a
        porpoise (sorry Dave) or just enjoy some background music run the
        command: `gl lucky` This will play a random Songza playlist for getting
        lucky.

        down.

        [activity](http://songza.com/discover/activity),[genre](http://songza.com/discover/genre). Also if the argument is more
        than one word you must put it in quotes.
