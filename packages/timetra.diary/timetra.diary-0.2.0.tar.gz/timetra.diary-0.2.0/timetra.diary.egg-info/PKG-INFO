Description: Timetra
        =======
        
        `Timetra` is a CLI time tracker application with a YAML backend.
        
        It also has a simple *curses* frontend and used to have a *web* one (which
        proved useless compared to CLI).
        
        Initially `Timetra` technically was a set of Hamster_ frontends.
        Now the backends are pluggable (the Hamster one was dropped completely).
