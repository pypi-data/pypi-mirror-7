OpenElectrophy is a python module for electrophysioly data analysis (intra- and extra-cellular).
OpenElectrophy is build on top of Neo :
    * It includes the powerful Neo IO that can read a quantity of data formats (Plexon, NeuroExplorer, Spike2, TDT, Axon, BlackRock, ...) 
    * Neo object ready for analyses (AnalogSIgnal, SpikeTrain, RecordingChannel, Segment, Block ...)

But OpenElectrophy also provide:
    * A GUI for exploring dataset
    * A complete offline spikesorting tool chain = GUI and/or command line.
    * A timefrequency toolbox = fast wavelet scalogram plotting +  transient oscillation in LFP detection.
    * Viewers for neo objects.
    * A database for storage.
