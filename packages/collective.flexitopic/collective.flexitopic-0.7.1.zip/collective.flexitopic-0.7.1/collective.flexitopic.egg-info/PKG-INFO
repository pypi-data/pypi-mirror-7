Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Flexitopic integrates the easy use of plone collections with a Flexigrid_
        AJAX view. The criteria from the topic are taken to construct a simple
        query form to narrow down a search inside a collection. Subtopics are
        displayed inside tabs of the (old style) collection.
        It works with new (`plone.app.collection.Collection`) and
        old (`Products.ATContentTypes.ATTopic`) style collections
        
        
        * Flexitopic does not install a new content type but just adds an additional view to the collection type.
        * it degrades for non javascript browsers to a simple table - (almost) same usability, no information loss.
        * it requires JQuery only (built into plone 4) no JQuery UI
        * lightweight JS
              * Flexigrid_: 27 KB packed
              * JSlider_: 22 KB packed

        Usage
        =====
        
        Add a collection. Criteria of the collection will be used to build
        a form to narrow down your search inside the collection. If the criterion (the
        index in portal_catalog) is sortable you can sort this column. Not all criteria
        types can be used as input for Flexi-collection so beware.
        
        Search Form
        ------------
        
        Search Text
          full text search inside the collections. If you leave the
          criterion value empty users can search for content containing that text, if
          the value is not empty it will search for this text plus the text the user
          supplied.
        Title
          search or sort by title (see above)
        Description
          search description only (search see above, no sorting here!)
        Dates (effective, created, ...)
          will be converted to date ranges and can be selected with the JQuery
          JSlider_ Plugin
        Location (path index)
          will not be displayed in the search form and always be applied to the query
        Keyword Indices (like tags)
          a drop down list will be generated to narrow the search down
        
          - if the criterion operator is AND the list will contain all unique
            values of the index minus the ones you selected, the query will search
            for all terms that match your criteria plus the user input (old style
            ciolletions only)
          - if the criterion is OR the terms you selected will be display in the
            selection list. The search will be for the user supplied input only.
            This is the behaviour for new style collections.
        
        The output is always a table with the fields you supplied in the
        ``Table Columns`` of the collection, no matter if ``Display as Table``
        is checked or not.
        
        Subtopics (old style collections only)
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Flexitopic will display subtopics as tabs on top of the page. The first
        tab is the description of the topic, subtopics will occupy the following
        tabs. Subtopics will always be displayed as (plain html) tables defined
        by the criteria,  ``Table Columns`` and the ``Number of Items`` of the
        subtopic.
        
        Portlets
        ---------
        
        You can display Topics and Collections in a Flexitopic portlet.
        The Portlet is mainly meant to be used with products that let you
        dispay portlets inside the content area such as ContentWellPortlets_
        or PortletPages_ but it may be usefull as a 'real' portlet in edge cases
        as well.
