Traits 3.3.0 (Feb 24, 2010)
===========================

Enhancements
------------

The major enhancement this release is that the entire Traits package has been
changed to use relative imports so that it can be installed as a sub-package
inside another larger library or package.  This was not previously possible,
since the various modules inside Traits would import each other directly
through "traits.[module]".  Many thanks to Darren Dale for the
patch.


Fixes
-----

There have been numerous minor bugfixes since the last release.  The most notable
ones are:

 * Many fixes involve making Traits UI more robust if wxPython is not installed
   on a system.  In the past, we have been able to use Qt if it was also
   installed, but removing Wx would lead to a variety of little bugs in various
   places.  We've squashed a number of these.  We've also added better checks
   to make sure we're selecting the right toolkit at import and at runtime.

 * A nasty cyclic reference was discovered and eliminated in DelegatesTo traits.

 * The Undefined and Uninitialized Traits were made into true singletons.

 * Much of the inconsistent formatting across the entire Traits source has
   been eliminated and normalized (tabs/spaces, line endings).
