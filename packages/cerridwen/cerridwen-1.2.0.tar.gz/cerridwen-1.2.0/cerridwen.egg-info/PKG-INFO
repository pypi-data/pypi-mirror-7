Description: Cerridwen
        =========
        
        Cerridwen provides planetary data that is suitable for both astronomical
        and astrological purposes. It comes with a simple command-line utility and
        a JSON server, but is also designed to serve as a basis for your own
        application.
        
        The motivation for this package is to have a reliable open-source library
        and API that provides comprehensive data on various planetary bodies and
        factors at a certain point in time.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Get comprehensive data on the sun and moon at almost any point in time
        
        * Rely on the high precision of the NASA JPL ephemeris
        
        * Make use of a powerful numpy-based algorithm for planetary event
          finding, (e.g. full moon, squares of planets etc.)
        
        * Work with Julian and ISO dates
        
        * Use Cerridwen's JSON API to ensure loose coupling
        
        * Extend Cerridwen with ease to suit your own needs

        Stability
        ---------
        
        Cerridwen includes a basic test suite for its calculations and API.
        
        At this time the API is reasonably stable but may change without
        warning. Please let me know when you need better API stability for
        your project.
