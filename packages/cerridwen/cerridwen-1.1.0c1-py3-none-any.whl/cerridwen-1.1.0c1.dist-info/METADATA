Cerridwen
=========

Cerridwen provides data on the moon that is suitable for both astronomical
and astrological purposes. It comes with a simple command-line utility and
a JSON server, but is also designed to serve as a basis for your own
application.

The motivation for this package is to have a reliable open-source library
and API that provides data on the moon and, eventually, other planetary
bodies at a certain point in time.


Features
--------

* Get comprehensive data on the sun and moon at almost any point in time

* Rely on the high precision of the NASA JPL ephemeris

* Make use of a powerful numpy-based algorithm for planetary event
  finding, (e.g. full moon, squares of planets etc.)

* Work with Julian and ISO dates

* Use Cerridwen's JSON API to ensure loose coupling

* Extend Cerridwen with ease to suit your own needs
