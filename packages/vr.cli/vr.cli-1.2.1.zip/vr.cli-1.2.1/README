vr.cli
======

A command-line interface for wrangling Velociraptor swarms and automating
some common operations.

Implementation
==============

The cli provides a command-line interface around the vr.common.models.

Features
========

``vr.cli`` supports several sub-commands, including:

 - build
 - swarm
 - uptests

For a complete list of commands, invoke vr.cli with --help.

Build
-----

Simply assemble a build of an app at a given tag. This routine is useful to
prime an build before doing other swarm operations.

Swarm
-----

This routine dispatch a swarm at a given tag::

    vr.cli swarm MyApp-Recipe_.* 3.0 -x Recipe_Skipped

It takes as its parameters a filter of swarm name, a version number, and
optionally some excludes.

The name filter is case sensitive, but the excludes are case insensitive.

Uptests
-------

This routine will provide a quick printout of all failing uptests.
