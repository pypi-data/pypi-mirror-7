Description: ============
        quora-backup
        ============
        
        A syncing approach to backing up Quora answers, questions, votes, and follows. Rather than fetching your entire history of Quora activity all at once, quora-backup checks your recent Quora activity and saves only the new entries. **Run it regularly to maintain a full backup.** This not only allows backups to be performed faster and more frequently, but also makes less requests to Quora's servers and doesn't face request rate-limiting issues like some older backup techniques do. It supports backing up to **JSON and CSV**. More file formats and databases to come.

            $ python backup.py --format csv Christopher-J-Su
        
        For a list of available backup formats, read the help (see [Usage](#usage) section).
        
        JSON Backup Details
        -------------------
        Your content will be stored in the following files, in whatever directory you run the above command in:
        
            answers.json
            questions.json
            upvotes.json
            question_follows.json
        
        CSV Backup Details
        ------------------
        Your content will be stored in the following files, in whatever directory you run the above command in:
        
            answers.csv
            questions.csv
            upvotes.csv
            question_follows.csv
        
        The resulting CSV output will have columns (fields/attributes) delimited by commas and rows (entries) delimited by new lines. The first row will be a header row, containing the names of the fields.
        
        Specifying an Activity

        You can also specify only one activity to be backed up. For instance, to only back up answers:
        
            $  python backup.py --type answers Christopher-J-Su
