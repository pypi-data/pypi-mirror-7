Plugin for ReproZip adding Vagrant support to the unpacker.

This requires reprounzip. It adds the 'reprounzip vagrant' subcommand which
builds a virtual machine template from a packed experiment, allowing to run it
on a different system/architecture (notably on Windows). You will need Vagrant
to run this virtual machine template.
