Ma`Proxy
===========

Ma`Proxy is a simple TCP proxy based on `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`.
Well, maybe not that simple, since it supports:
	* TCP -> TCP		: simple reverse proxy.
						Whatever data goes in , goes out

	* TCP -> SSL		: proxy to encrypt incoming data.
						a.k.a stunnel
					  
	* SSL -> TCP		: proxy to decrypt incoming data
						a.k.a SSL-terminator or SSL-decryptor

	* SSL- > SSL		: whatever gets in will be decrypted and then encrypted again

	* Each SSL can be used with SSL certificates. including client-certificates !!


**TBD:** Add sample-code here
