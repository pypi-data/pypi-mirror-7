Description: ===========
        Ma`Proxy
        ===========
        
        Ma`Proxy is a simple TCP proxy based on `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_.
        
        Well, maybe not that simple, since it supports:
        
        * TCP -> TCP
            simple reverse proxy.
            Whatever data goes in , goes out
        
        * TCP -> SSL 
            proxy to encrypt incoming data.
            a.k.a stunnel
        					  
        * SSL -> TCP
            proxy to decrypt incoming data
            a.k.a SSL-terminator or SSL-decryptor
        
        * SSL- > SSL
            whatever gets in will be decrypted and then encrypted again
            
        * Each SSL can be used with SSL certificates. including client-certificates !!
