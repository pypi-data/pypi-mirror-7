        pox: utilities for filesystem exploration and automated builds
        --------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Pox provides a collection of utilities for navigating and manipulating
        filesystems. This module is designed to facilitate some of the low level
        operating system interactions that are useful when exploring a filesystem
        on a remote host, where queries such as "what is the root of the filesystem?",
        "what is the user's name?", and "what login shell is preferred?" become
        essential in allowing a remote user to function as if they were logged in
        locally. While pox is in the same vein of both the `os` and `shutil`
        builtin modules, the majority of its functionality is unique and compliments
        these two modules.
        
        Pox provides python equivalents of several unix shell commands such as
        "which" and "find". These commands allow automated discovery of what has
        been installed on an operating system, and where the essential tools are
        located. This capability is useful not only for exploring remote hosts,
        but also locally as a helper utility for automated build and installation.
        
        Several high-level operations on files and filesystems are also provided.
        Examples of which are: finding the location of an installed python package,
        determining if and where the source code resides on the filesystem, and
        determining what version the installed package is.
        
        Pox also provides utilities to enable the abstraction of commands sent
        to a remote filesystem.  In conjunction with a registry of environment
        variables and installed utilites, pox enables the user to interact with
        a remote filesystem as if they were logged in locally. 
        
        Pox is part of pathos, a python framework for heterogeneous computing.
        Pox is in the early development stages, and any user feedback is
        highly appreciated. Contact Mike McKerns [mmckerns at caltech dot edu]
        with comments, suggestions, and any bugs you may find. A list of known
        issues is maintained at http://dev.danse.us/trac/pathos/query.
        
        
        Major Features
        ==============
        
        Pox provides utilities for discovering the user's environment::
        
            - return the user's name, current shell, and path to user's home directory
            - strip duplicate entries from the user's $PATH
            - lookup and expand environment variables from ${VAR} to 'value'
        
        Pox also provides utilities for filesystem exploration and manipulation::
        
            - discover the path to a file, exectuable, directory, or symbolic link 
            - discover the path to an installed package
            - parse operating system commands for remote shell invocation
            - convert text files to platform-specific formatting
        
        
        Current Release
        ===============
        
        This release version is pox-0.2. You can download it here.
        The latest released version of pox is always available from:
        
            http://dev.danse.us/trac/pathos
        
        Pox is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.
        
        
        Development Release
        ===================
        
        You can get the latest development release with all the shiny new features at::
        
            http://dev.danse.us/packages
        
        or even better, fork us on our github mirror of the svn trunk::
        
            https://github.com/uqfoundation
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Pox is packaged to install from source, so you must
        download the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::
        
            [download]
            $ tar -xvzf pox-0.2.tgz
            $ cd pox-0.2
            $ python setup py build
            $ python setup py install
        
        You will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings
        after you run the "build" step above. 
        
        Alternately, pox can be installed with easy_install::
        
            [download]
            $ easy_install -f . pox
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Pox requires::
        
            - python2, version >= 2.5  *or*  python3, version >= 3.1
        
        Optional requirements::
        
            - setuptools, version >= 0.6
        
        
        Usage Notes
        ===========
        
        Probably the best way to get started is to look at the tests
        that are provided within pox. See `pox.tests` for a set of scripts
        that demonstrate pox's ability to interact with the operating system.
        Pox utilities can also be run directly from an operating system terminal,
        using the `pox_launcher.py` script.
