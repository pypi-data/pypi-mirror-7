        Tangled.Web is a somewhat opinionated, resource oriented Web framework. It
        might be considered a "micro" framework because it simply provides a way to map
        HTTP requests to resources and has no opinions regarding databases, templating,
        etc.
        
        Unlike many other frameworks, there are no "views" or "controllers" here, only
        resources. Resources respond to HTTP requests and return representations based
        on the client's preference (indicated via Accept headers).

        Python 3
        ========
        
        Tangled.Web runs *only* on Python 3.3+. Part of the reason for this is simply
        that I didn't feel like dealing with straddling 2|3. I also wanted to use some
        features that aren't available in earlier versions (e.g., built-in namespace
        packages). Finally, I've been itching to really learn all the new Python 3
        goodness, and a Python 3 only project seemed like a good way to do that (it
        has been so far).
        
        I'm also of the opinion that Python 3 has *almost* arrived. Most of the
        libraries I've been using for the past several years (SQLAlchemy, Mako, WebOb,
        etc) have already been ported.
