SteelScript NetProfiler Tutorial
================================

This tutorial will walk through the main components of the SteelScript
interfaces for Riverbed SteelCentral NetProfiler.  It is assumed that
you have a basic understanding of the Python programming language.

The tutorial has been organized so you can follow it sequentially.
Throughout the examples, you will be expected to fill in details
specific to your environment.  These will be called out using a dollar
sign ``$<name>`` -- for example ``$host`` indicates you should fill in
the host name or IP address of a NetProfiler appliance.

Whenever you see ``>>>``, this indicates an interactive session using
the Python shell.  The command that you are expected to type follows
the ``>>>``.  The result of the command follows.  Any lines with a
``#`` are just comments to describe what is happening.  In many cases
the exact output will depend on your environment, so it may not match
precisely what you see in this tutorial.

Background
----------

NetProfiler provides centralized reporting and analysis of the data
collected by other SteelCentral appliances (i.e., Flow Gateway, and
NetShark) and SteelHead products on a single user interface.
SteelScript for NetProfiler makes this this wealth of data easily
accessible via Python.

NetProfiler Objects
-------------------

Interacting with a NetProfiler leverages two key classes:

* :py:class:`NetProfiler <netprofiler.NetProfiler>` - provides
  the primary interface to the appliance, handling initialization,
  setup, and communication via REST API calls.

* :py:class:`Report <report.Report>` - talks
  through the NetProfiler to create new reports and pull data from
  existing reports.

In most cases you will not use Report directly -- your scripts will
use a more helpful object tailored to the desired report, such as a
:py:class:`TrafficSummaryReport <report.TrafficSummaryReport>` or a
:py:class:`TrafficOverallTimeSeriesReport
<report.TrafficOverallTimeSeriesReport>`.  We'll cover those shortly.

Outside of handling all the communication back and forth,
:py:class:`NetProfiler <netprofiler.NetProfiler>` also handles all of
the different report columns that could be desired.  It provides a
helpful interface to offer up available columns by report type, and
ensures that any chosen columns are in fact appropriate.

With that brief overview, let's get started.

Startup
-------

As with any Python code, the first step is to import the module(s) we
intend to use.  The SteelScript code for working with NetProfiler
appliances resides in a module called
:py:mod:`steelscript.netprofiler.core`.  The main class in this module
is :py:class:`NetProfiler <netprofiler.NetProfiler>`.  This object
represents a connection to a NetProfiler appliance.

To start, start python from the shell or command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python
   Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 19 2012, 00:55:09)
   [GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)] on darwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>

Once in the python shell, let's create a NetProfiler object:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from steelscript.netprofiler.core import NetProfiler
   >>> from steelscript.common.service import UserAuth
   >>> p = NetProfiler('$hostname', auth=UserAuth('$username', '$password'))

Replace the first argument ``$hostname`` with the hostname or IP
address of the NetProfiler appliance.  The second argument is an auth
parameter and identifies the authentication method to use -- in this
case, simple username/password is used.  OAuth 2.0 is supported as
well, but we will focus on basic authentication for this tutorial.

As soon as the ``NetProfiler`` object is created, a connection is
established to the appliance, the authentication credentials are
validated, and hierarchy of available columns is loaded.  If the
username and password are not correct, you will immediately see an
exception.  Also, if this is the first time initializing a
``NetProfiler`` object, there will be a short delay while all of the
columns are fetched from the appliance and cached locally.

The ``p`` object is the basis for all communication with the
NetProfiler appliance.  We can get some basic version information by
simply looking at the 'version' attribute:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print p.version
   '10.1 (release 20130204_1200)'

Before moving on, exit the python interactive shell:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> [Ctrl-D]
   $

Generating Reports
------------------

Reports are the mechanisim to extract all the myriad of data from
:py:class:`NetProfiler` into any format desired.  We will create a short script
that provides a command-line interface to generate reports on the fly.

Create a new file in a working directory of your choice, call it ``myreport.py``,
and insert the following lines:

.. code-block:: python

   import pprint

   from steelscript.netprofiler.core import NetProfiler

   from steelscript.common.service import UserAuth
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.filters import TimeFilter
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.report import TrafficSummaryReport

   # connection information
   username = '$username'
   password = '$password'
   auth = UserAuth(username, password)
   host = '$host'

   # create a new NetProfiler instance
   p = NetProfiler(host, auth=auth)

   # setup basic info for our report
   columns = [p.columns.key.host_ip,
              p.columns.value.avg_bytes,
              p.columns.value.network_rtt]
   sort_column = p.columns.value.avg_bytes
   timefilter = TimeFilter.parse_range("last 5 m")

   # initialize a new report, and run it
   report = TrafficSummaryReport(p)
   report.run('hos', columns, timefilter=timefilter, sort_col=sort_column)

   # grab the data, and legend (it should be what we passed in for most cases)
   data = report.get_data()
   legend = report.get_legend()

   # once we have what we need, delete the report from the NetProfiler
   report.delete()

   # print out the top ten hosts!
   pprint.pprint(data[:10])

Be sure to fill in appropriate values for ``$host``, ``$username`` and ``$password``.
Run this script as follows and you should see something like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python myreport.py
   [['10.100.6.12', 1733552.81667, ''],
    ['10.99.18.154', 1027017.35, 0.124],
    ['10.100.5.12', 814550.3, ''],
    ['10.100.5.13', 707320.527778, ''],
    ['10.100.6.14', 691441.777778, ''],
    ['10.100.6.10', 525593.25, ''],
    ['10.100.120.108', 455330.638889, ''],
    ['10.100.5.11', 443483.577778, ''],
    ['10.100.6.11', 385050.85, ''],
    ['10.100.201.33', 371349.105556, 0.046]]

We've created our first report!  Let's take a closer look at what we just did.

.. code-block:: bash

   import pprint

   from steelscript.netprofiler.core import NetProfiler

   from steelscript.common.service import UserAuth
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.filters import TimeFilter
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.report import TrafficSummaryReport

These first few lines import our SteelScript modules and prepare them
for use in the rest of the script.  The Python Style guide (`PEP8
<http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_) indicates that common
or built-in modules like ``pprint`` are imported first, and custom
modules (like SteelScript) follow after.

.. code-block:: python

   # connection information
   username = '$username'
   password = '$password'
   auth = UserAuth(username, password)
   host = '$host'

These are our login credentials.  We have them hard-coded into the script for
an example here, but we will show how to have these supplied on the command line
shortly.

.. code-block:: python

   # create a new NetProfiler instance
   p = NetProfiler(host, auth=auth)

   # setup basic info for our report
   columns = [p.columns.key.host_ip,
              p.columns.value.avg_bytes,
              p.columns.value.network_rtt]
   sort_column = p.columns.value.avg_bytes
   timefilter = TimeFilter.parse_range("last 5 m")

   # initialize a new report, and run it
   report = TrafficSummaryReport(p)
   report.run('hos', columns, timefilter=timefilter, sort_col=sort_column)

Now things get interesting.  After initializing a new NetProfiler instance,
we define some of the settings we want to use in our report:

* ``columns`` is a list of column types we want to use in our report

* ``sort_column`` indicates which column NetProfiler should use to sort on

* ``timefilter`` provides a time range for what time period the report
   should be limited to

Next, a new report instance is created, and the variables we just defined are
used to generate a report.

.. code-block:: python

   # grab the data, and legend (it should be what we passed in for most cases)
   data = report.get_data()
   legend = report.get_legend()

   # once we have what we need, delete the report from the NetProfiler
   report.delete()

   # print out the top ten hosts!
   pprint.pprint(data[:10])

Here, the comments pretty well walk through what is happening.  Deleting
reports helps keep things tidy, but doesn't cause harm if they are left around.
After a period of time the appliance will cleanup any leftover reports after 24
hours.

Finally, since we included a column to sort on in our report request, we can
just limit the output to the first ten items to get the top ten.

Reporting Columns
-----------------

We chose only a small subset of the available columns for our example script.
We could include any columns applicable for this report type.  To help identify
which columns are available, we could start up a python console and try some of
the commands discussed in the `Profile Columns <columns.html>`_
section, or we could use the helper command ``steel netprofiler columns``.

The ``steel`` sommand should have been installed in one of your local
``bin`` directories (``Scripts`` on Windows).  Try the following
command to see if its on your path:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ which steel

If that doesn't return a path, then you will need to add the directory where
has been installed to your shell's system path.

Now that you are setup, let's find some columns.

In our example, we glossed over the specific realm, centricity, and groupby that
was selected.  For a TrafficSummaryReport, those three items could be as follows:

=============== ============================================================
Parameter       Possible values
=============== ============================================================
``realm``       ``traffic_summary``
``centricity``  ``hos``, ``int``
``groupby``     any type except ``time_host_user``, our example used ``host``
=============== ============================================================

Enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ steel netprofiler columns -h
   Usage: steel netprofiler columns HOST [options] ...

   List columns available for NetProfiler reports
   Required Arguments:

     HOST        NetProfiler hostname or IP address

   Options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit

   [...text continues...]

And you will see all of the available options to the script.  One thing you
will see are options for host, username, and password.  Where we had
those hardcoded in our example, now we pass them as options to the script.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ steel netprofiler columns $hostname -u $username -p $password

This will just execute and print nothing out if it was able to successfully
connect.  Now, let's add our triplet information:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ steel netprofiler columns $hostname -u $username -p $password -r traffic_summary
     -c hos -g host --list-columns

   Key Columns        Label                  ID
   -------------------------------------------------
   group_name         Group                  23
   [...text continues...]

   Value Columns                    Label                               ID
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   avg_bytes                        Avg Bytes/s                         33
   avg_bytes_app                    Avg App Bytes/s                     504
   [...text continues...]


The available key and value columns will be presented.  If additional columns were
desired for your report, select from this list.

We have chosen ``host`` as our groupby option, but to get a full list of what is available,
use the '--list-groupbys' option:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ steel netprofiler columns $hostname -u $username -p $password --list-groupbys

   GroupBy                      Id
   ------------------------------------
   host_pair                    hop
   ip_mac_pair                  ipp
   port_group                   pgr
   [...text continues...]

Note that the correct value to pass in the ``steel netprofiler
columns`` script is the groupby name, not the Id.

Once you have found the set of columns you are interested in, you will now have
a means of including them in your report request.  The following syntax would
be one way to reference them:

.. code-block:: python

   columns = [p.columns.key.host_ip,
              p.columns.value.avg_bytes,
              p.columns.value.network_rtt]

Assuming ``p`` is a NetProfiler instance, this would be one format to create
a list of key and value columns.  Keys are named ``p.columns.key.<colname>`` and
values are named ``p.columns.value.<colname>``.

Additional discussion on columns can be found `here <columns.html>`_.

Extending the Example
---------------------

As a last item to help get started with your own scripts, we will extend our example
with two helpful features: command-line options and table outputs.

Rather than show how to update your existing example script, we will post the new
script below, then walk through key differences that add the features we are looking for.

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python

   import optparse

   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.filters import TimeFilter
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.report import TrafficSummaryReport
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.app import NetProfilerApp
   from steelscript.common.utils import Formatter

   class ExampleApp(NetProfilerApp):

       def add_options(self, parser):
           group = optparse.OptionGroup(parser, "Example Options")
           group.add_option('-r', '--timerange', dest='timerange', default=None,
                            help='Time range to limit report to, e.g. "last 5 m"')
           parser.add_option_group(group)

       def main(self):
           p = self.netprofiler

           report = TrafficSummaryReport(p)

           columns = [p.columns.key.host_ip,
                      p.columns.value.avg_bytes,
                      p.columns.value.network_rtt]
           sort_column = p.columns.value.avg_bytes

           timefilter = TimeFilter.parse_range(self.options.timerange)

           report.run('hos', columns, timefilter=timefilter, sort_col=sort_column)
           data = report.get_data()
           legend = report.get_legend()
           report.delete()

           header = [c.key for c in columns]
           Formatter.print_table(data[:10], header)

   ExampleApp().run()

Copy that code into a new file, and run it with a timerange option,
and you will find the same base set of options used for ``steel
netprofiler columns`` are now included in this script.  Primarily,
``hostname``, ``username``, ``password`` are now all items to be
passed to the script.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   > python myreport2.py $hosthame -u $username -p $password -r "last 10 min"

   host_ip           avg_bytes        network_rtt
   --------------------------------------------------
   10.100.6.12       683349.295833
   10.100.5.13       653938.525
   10.100.120.108    572001.791667
   10.100.5.11       438921.75
   10.100.201.30     405558.216667    0.051
   10.100.5.12       398773.9875
   10.100.201.20     359039.758333    0.153
   10.100.201.21     306396.929167    0.154
   10.100.202.2      301756.991667    0.011
   10.100.201.32     293926.695833    0.064

We also get a nicely formatted table, too!

First we needed to import some new items:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python

   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.filters import TimeFilter
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.report import TrafficSummaryReport
   from steelscript.netprofiler.core.app import NetProfilerApp
   from steelscript.common.utils import Formatter

   import optparse

That bit at the top is called a shebang, it tells the system that it should
execute this script using the program after the '#!'.  We are also importing
``NetProfilerApp`` and ``Formatter`` classes to help with our new updates.  The
built-in library ``optparse`` is used to parse command-line options.

.. code-block:: python

   class ExampleApp(NetProfilerApp):

       def add_options(self, parser):
           group = optparse.OptionGroup(parser, "Example Options")
           group.add_option('-r', '--timerange', dest='timerange', default=None,
                            help='Time range to limit report to, e.g. "last 5 m"')
           parser.add_option_group(group)

This section begins the definition of a new class, which inherits from the
class NetProfilerApp.  This is some of the magic of object-oriented programming,
a lot of functionality is defined as part of NetProfilerApp, including the
basics of authentication, and setting up a NetProfiler instance, and we get all
of that for *free*, just by inheriting from it.  In fact, we go beyond that,
and *extend* its functionality by defining the function ``add_options``.  Here,
we add a new option to pass in a timerange on the commandline.

.. code-block:: python

       def main(self):
           p = self.netprofiler

           report = TrafficSummaryReport(p)

           columns = [p.columns.key.host_ip,
                      p.columns.value.avg_bytes,
                      p.columns.value.network_rtt]
           sort_column = p.columns.value.avg_bytes

           timefilter = TimeFilter.parse_range(self.options.timerange)

           report.run('hos', columns, timefilter=timefilter, sort_col=sort_column)
           data = report.get_data()
           legend = report.get_legend()
           report.delete()

           header = [c.key for c in columns]
           Formatter.print_table(data[:10], header)

   ExampleApp().run()

This is the main part of the script, and remains mostly unchanged from our previous
version.  Rather than create the NetProfiler instance directly, that is now being
done for us as part of NetProfilerApp.  We just need to reference it as shown.

The timefilter option is now being pulled from the command-line,
``self.options.timerange``, so we have one additional item that can be varied
from run to run.

Next, we have to run some small magic to pull out the key information
from each of the column objects.  The expression in the brackets for
the header assignment is called a `list comprehension
<http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions>`_.
Think of it like a condensed for-loop.  Once we have a header, we pass
that along with our data to the ``Formatter.print_table`` function,
and that will print out our data nicely formatted into columns.

The last line calls the main run-loop as defined in the NetProfilerApp class,
and the rest should function as before.
