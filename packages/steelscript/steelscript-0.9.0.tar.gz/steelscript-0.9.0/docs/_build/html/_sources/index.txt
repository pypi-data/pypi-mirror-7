Riverbed SteelScript for Python
===============================

Welcome, this is the documentation for Riverbed SteelScript for Python.
SteelScript is a collection of Python modules that build upon
REST APIs and other interfaces to interact with Riverbed appliances
and software.

Quick Start
-----------

If you already have pip, just run the following (in a
`virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_):

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install steelscript
   $ steel install

Not sure about pip, but you know you have Python?

1. Download :download:`steel_bootstrap.py`

2. Run it (in a `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_):

   .. code:: bash

      $ python steel_bootstrap.py install

SteelScript Application Framework
---------------------------------

The SteelScript Application Framework makes it easy to create a fully
custom web application that mashes up data from multiple sources.  It comes
pre-configured with several reports for NetProfiler and NetShark.

Once you have the base ``steelscript`` package installed, getting started
is just a few commands away:

.. code:: bash

   $ steel install --appfwk
   $ steel appfwk mkproject

This will populate a local directory with all the files you need to run
the server in "dev" mode on your local system.

For more details, see the :doc:`complete documentation <appfwk/overview>`.
