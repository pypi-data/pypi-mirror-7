Description: txSkyDrive
        ----------
        
        Twisted-based python async interface for `SkyDrive API (version
        5.0) <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/live/hh826521>`_.
        
        API is mostly the same as in
        `python-skydrive <https://github.com/mk-fg/python-skydrive>`_ module
        (txSkyDriveAPI class maps to SkyDriveAPIWrapper, txSkyDrive to
        SkyDriveAPI) - methods are re-used directly from classes there, so more
        info on these can be found in that project.
        
        Key difference from synchronous python-skydrive module is that all
        methods return twisted Deferred objects as scheduled to run by event
        loop, allowing to run multiple operations (like large file uploads)
        concurrently within one python process.
        
        Usage Example
        -------------
        
        Following script will print listing of the root SkyDrive folder, upload
        "test.txt" file there, try to find it in updated folder listing and then
        remove it.
        
        ::
        
            from twisted.internet import defer, reactor
            from txskydrive import txSkyDrivePersistent
        
            @defer.inlineCallbacks
            def do_stuff():
                api = txSkyDrivePersistent.from_conf()
        
                # Print root directory ("me/skydrive") listing
                print list(e['name'] for e in (yield api.listdir()))
        
                # Upload "test.txt" file from local current directory
                file_info = yield api.put('test.txt')
        
                # Find just-uploaded "test.txt" file by name
                file_id = yield api.resolve_path('test.txt')
        
                # Check that id matches uploaded file
                assert file_info['id'] == file_id
        
                # Remove the file
                yield api.delete(file_id)
        
            do_stuff().addCallback(lambda ignored: reactor.stop())
            reactor.run()
        
        Note that txSkyDriveAPIPersistent convenience class uses Microsoft
        LiveConnect authentication data from "~/.lcrc" file, which must be
        created as described in more detail `in python-skydrive
        docs <https://github.com/mk-fg/python-skydrive#command-line-usage>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It's a regular package for Python 2.7 (not 3.X).
        
        Using `pip <http://pip-installer.org/>`_ is the best way:
        
        ::
        
            % pip install txskydrive
        
        If you don't have it, use:
        
        ::
        
            % easy_install pip
            % pip install txskydrive
        
        Alternatively (`see
        also <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_):
        
        ::
        
            % curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python
            % pip install txskydrive
        
        Or, if you absolutely must:
        
        ::
        
            % easy_install txskydrive
        
        But, you really shouldn't do that.
        
        Current-git version can be installed like this:
        
        ::
        
            % pip install 'git+https://github.com/mk-fg/txskydrive.git#egg=txskydrive'
        
        Note that to install stuff in system-wide PATH and site-packages,
        elevated privileges are often required. Use "install --user",
        `~/.pydistutils.cfg <http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#distutils-configuration-files>`_
        or `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to do
        unprivileged installs into custom paths.
