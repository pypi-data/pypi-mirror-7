Description: sostore is a straightforward storage engine for storing and retrieving 
        dictionaries from an SQLite database.  Much of the terminology is taken
        from MongoDB as this engine was originally designed to replace a PyMongo
        implementation.
        
        This library may seem trivial because it very much is.  However, some 
        others may need a super-lightweight dictionary store.  Linking of 
        objects within the database is not supported unless explicitly handled 
        by the developer.
        
        sostore is almost certainly not performant.  It can be thread-safe as 
        long as Collection objects aren't passed around between threads as they
        contain sqlite3.Connection objects.
