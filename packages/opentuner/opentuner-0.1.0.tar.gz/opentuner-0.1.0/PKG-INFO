Description: OpenTuner
        =========
        
        Program autotuning has been demonstrated in many domains to achieve
        better or more portable performance. However, autotuners themselves are
        often not very portable between projects because using a domain informed
        search space representation is critical to achieving good results and
        because no single search technique performs best for all problems.
        
        OpenTuner is a new framework for building domain-specific
        multi-objective program autotuners. OpenTuner supports fully
        customizable configuration representations, an extensible technique
        representation to allow for domain-specific techniques, and an easy to
        use interface for communicating with the tuned program. A key capability
        inside OpenTuner is the use of ensembles of disparate search techniques
        simultaneously, techniques which perform well will receive larger
        testing budgets and techniques which perform poorly will be disabled.
        
        System dependencies
        -------------------
        
        A list of system dependencies can be found in
        `debian-packages-deps <https://raw.github.com/jansel/opentuner/master/debian-packages-deps>`__
        which are primarily python 2.6+ (not 3.x) and sqlite3 (or your
        `supported <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/dialects/index.html>`__
        database backend of choice).
        
        On Ubuntu/Debian there can be installed with:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install `cat debian-packages-deps | tr '\n' ' '`
        
        Python dependencies
        -------------------
        
        A list of python dependencies can be found in
        `python-packages <https://raw.github.com/jansel/opentuner/master/python-packages>`__
        these can either be installed system-wide with ``pip`` or
        ``easy_install``.
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install python-pip
            sudo pip install -r python-packages
        
        Or you can use virtual env to create a isolated python environment by
        running:
        
        ::
        
            python ./venv-bootstrap.py
        
        which will create a ./venv/bin/python (./venv/Scripts/python.exe on
        windows) with all the required packages installed.
        
        Checking Installation
        ---------------------
        
        Quickly checking that a successful installation has been made, may be
        performed by running an example program such as:
        
        ::
        
            ./examples/rosenbrock/rosenbrock.py
