        `keysight <https://github.com/questrail/keysight>`__ is a Python (2.6+)

        `keysight <https://github.com/questrail/keysight>`__ is developed using
        `Scott Chacon <http://scottchacon.com/about.html>`__'s `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__. To
        contribute, fork `keysight <https://github.com/questrail/keysight>`__,
        create a feature branch, and then submit a pull request. `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__ is
        summarized as:
        
        -  Anything in the ``master`` branch is deployable
        -  To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
           ``master`` (e.g., ``new-oauth2-scopes``)
        -  Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the
           same named branch on the server
        -  When you need feedback or help, or you think the brnach is ready for
           merging, open a `pull
           request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`__.
        -  After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you
           can merge it into master.
        -  Once it is merged and pushed to ``master``, you can and *should*
           deploy immediately.
