Description: GFM
        ===
        
        GFM is a small module to convert `GitHub Flavored Markdown`_ to HTML.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        GFM offers two methods, ``gfm`` and ``markdown``.
        
        ``gfm`` simply preprocesses the parts of Markdown that GitHub Flavored
        Markdown is interested in, without converting the Markdown to HTML.
        
        ``markdown`` does this as well as passing the result through the
        ``markdown`` module to generate HTML.
        
        ::
        
            >>> import gfm
            >>> string = "Roses are red\nViolets are blue"
            >>> gfm.gfm(string)
            'Roses are red  \nViolets are blue'
            >>> gfm.markdown(string)
            '<p>Roses are red<br />\nViolets are blue</p>'
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install gfm
