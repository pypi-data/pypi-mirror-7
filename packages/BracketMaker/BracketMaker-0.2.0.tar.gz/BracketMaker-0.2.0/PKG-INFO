Description: =============
        BracketMaker
        =============
        
        BracketMaker is used to create brackets of any size and neatly print them to the screen. It is useful for visually representing tournaments and updating them on the fly. Main.py is used for storing brackets in a file and opening and editing them later.
        
        
        Included Files
        ==============
        
        * bin/main.py
          - store and update brackets (uses bracket.bracket)
        
        * bracket/bracket.py
          - python module used for creating and displaying brackets
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Python must be installed in order for BracketMaker to run. Install python at https://www.python.org/download/. In the terminal type “cd path/to/this/directory” and then “python setup.py install”. This will add the bracket module to your site-packages.
        
        
        How to Run
        ==========
        
        You can either choose to run a finished python program that uses the bracket module or create your own script with the module. If you want to just run the finished version, the file will be found in the “bin” directory. Double click on the file or type “python main.py” in the terminal to run. To use the bracket module in your own program the include it at the top of the file with “from bracket import bracket”. There is only one module in the “bracket” directory.
        
        
        How to Use main.py
        ==================
        
        In the main menu, your options are to create a new bracket or open an existing one. 
        
        New Bracket
        -----------
        You will be asked to enter a name and location to save the bracket. The location must be the full path excluding the name of the bracket. Then you must enter the number of teams that will participate in the tournament and their names. You will also be asked to shuffle the teams. Enter yes if you want to give the teams random seeds. Enter no to use the way you enter the teams as the rankings.
        
        Open Bracket
        ------------
        Enter the full path of where the bracket was saved including the name of the bracket.
        
        Updating the Bracket
        --------------------
        Type the name of a team that should go on to the next round. You can type multiple teams at once by separating the names with a comma. You can also edit incorrect updates by typing the other team that should have one instead.
        
        Quit and Save
        -------------
        In the update screen type “quit” to quit and save. This will return you to the main menu as well.
        
        Command Line Arguments
        ----------------------
        There is only one additional argument for main.py. It is “-f” to show the full output of the program and never clear the screen. To use this feature open the terminal and type “python path/to/directory/main.py -f”.
