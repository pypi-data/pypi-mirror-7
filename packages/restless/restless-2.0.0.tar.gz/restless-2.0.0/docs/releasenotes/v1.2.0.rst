restless v1.2.0
===============

:date: 2014-01-15

**BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE:** This release alters the Pyramid ``add_views`` method
signature slightly, to be more idiomatic. It changed from ``endpoint_prefix``
to become ``routename_prefix``.

Given that the Pyramid support was first released yesterday & this is an
optional argument, the hope is the impact of this change is low. This should
be (barring any security fixes) the only backward-incompatible change before
v2.0.0.
