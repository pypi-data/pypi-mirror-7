Description: OpenAccess_EPUB is a program for converting OpenAccess Academic Journal
        articles into the ePub format.
        
        Documentation for the project is hosted on 
        [Read the Docs](http://openaccess-epub.readthedocs.org)
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        You can install OpenAccess_EPUB from the source at the
        [project page](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/OpenAccess_EPUB).
        
        or you can install with pip.
        
        `pip install openaccess_epub`
        
        OpenAccess_EPUB is only compatible with Python3, so make sure that you install
        it with the correct version if you have more than one Python version.
        
        Additional requirements are [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) and
        [lxml](http://lxml.de/), which pip will attempt to install for you.
        
        Once you've successfully installed OpenAccess_EPUB and its dependencies,
        access the interface using
        
        `oaepub`
        
        This can be followed by various subcommands and help
        regarding the usage can be retrieved by
        
        `oaepub -h`
        
        `oaepub convert -h`
         
         etc.
        
        Use the `oaepub configure` command to set up some local OpenAccess_EPUB
        configuration interactively before converting articles to EPUB.
