"""
The ``docit`` package can be loaded as a |SPHINX| extension, and provides some
functionality for controlling whether or not members are documented by the
|autodoc| extension.

To use this extension, simply enable it in your |SPHINX| `conf.py <http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html>`_

    .. code:: python

        extensions = [
            'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
            'docit.ext',
            # ...
        ]

Note that you'll still need to enable the |autodoc| extension in order to
actually use autodoc.

To control in your code whether or not an object gets included by |autodoc|,
use the `docit` and `nodoc` wrappers on classes and functions. For instance:

    .. code:: python

        from docit import docit, nodoc

        class MyClass(object):
            
            @docit
            def __str__(self):
                \"\"\"
                This function is not normally included unless the
                ``:special-members:`` flag is set for the relevenat autodoc
                directive.

                However, by using the ``docit`` decorator, we can force it to be
                included.
                \"\"\"
                return "foo"

            @nodoc
            def frob(self):
                \"\"\"
                This function will not be included in the autodoc, because of the
                ``nodoc`` decorator on it.
                \"\"\"
                pass

    corresponding handler function attached to the |autodoc-skip-member| event,
    for instance, `~docit.ext.docit_skip_member`, which is `setup <docit.ext.setup>` when
    the ``docit.ext`` extension is loaded in |SPHINX|.
