        Installation
        ------------
        
        With python3, it'easy as:
        
        .. code-block:: python
          
          pip install ewmh
        
        Unfortunately for python 2 users, you will have to manually install
        the required dependency **Xlib** from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-xlib/0.12,
        until the xlib developpers send a version for python2 on PyPi.
        
        Once this is done, just
        
        .. code-block:: python
          
          python setup.py install
        
        This will do the work.
