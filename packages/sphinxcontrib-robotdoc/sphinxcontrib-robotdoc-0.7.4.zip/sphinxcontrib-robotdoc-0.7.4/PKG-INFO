Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This package provides a Sphinx-extension to embed Robot Framework test suites,
        test cases, or user keywords in into Sphinx-documents in spirit of the autodoc
        Sphinx-extension.
        
        
        When to use?
        ------------
        
        Consider not using this package.
        
        This package was created before Robot Framework plain text syntax lexer
        (highlighting support) was implemented and included into Pygments (>= 1.6rc1).
        This package was also created before Robot Framework's built-in libdoc-tool got
        ReST-syntax support for embedded documentation syntax (>=1.7.5) and Robot
        Framework got new ReST-support (>= 1.8.2).
        
        Nowadays, the easies way to embed Robot Framework code (plain text syntax) into
        Sphinx-document should be to simply use the standard ``.. code-block::
        robotframework`` or include libdoc-generated html with ``:download:``-syntax.
        Yet, there may be some edge cases where this is the most convenient way to
        embed external Robot examples into your documentation.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add ``sphinxcontrib_robotdoc`` into the extensions list of your Sphinx
        configuration (``conf.py``)::
        
            extensions = [
                "sphinxcontrib_robotdoc",
            ]
        
        Embed test cases and user keywords into your documentation with the
        following custom Docutils-directives::
        
            .. robot-tests:: Test case title or RegExp.*
               :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.robot
               :tags: bugs, new
        
            .. robot-keywords:: Keyword title or RegExp.*
               :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
        
        Both directives (``robot-tests`` and ``robot-keywords``) take a regular
        expression as their main option (or *content* in Docutils' terms) to filter the
        embeded test cases or keywords found from the given ``source``-resource (or
        relative path). If no regular expression is given, all found tests or keywords
        will be embedded (like having ``.*`` as the default).
        
        Path given to the mandatory ``source``-option must be either be a package
        resources (using syntax *package_name:resource/path/in/package*) or a relative
        path from the current document.
        
        The test case directive (``robot-tests``) accepts also an option ``tags``,
        which is optional. It should inclue a comma separated list of the tags to be
        used when filtering the tests to be embedded.
        
        Both directives take an optional ``style``-option. When ``style`` is set
        to ``expanded`` the output will include headings such as the table name and
        test case or keyword name. When ``style`` is set to ``minimal`` the output
        will include only the target documentation strings without any robot syntax.
        
        Please, note that he documentation found from the embedded test is parsed
        using Docutils, as a part of the target document. This differs from `Robot
        Framework`_'s own documentation tools, which expect its own custom markup.
        
        .. _Robot Framework: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework
        
        
        Other directives
        ----------------
        
        ``robot-source`` will embed a complete test suite or resource file with
        syntax highlighting::
        
            .. robot-source::
               :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
        
        ``robot-settings`` will embed a syntax highlighted settings table (with
        documentation parsed as reStructuredText) for a test suite a resource file::
        
            .. robot-settings::
               :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
        
        ``robot-variables`` will embed a syntax highlighted variables table (with
        documentation parsed as reStructuredText) for a test suite a resource file::
        
            .. robot-variables::
               :source: my_package:tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
        
        Also directives ``robot-settings`` and ``robot-variables`` take an optional
        ``style``-option. When ``style`` is set to ``expanded`` the output will
        include the table name.
        
        
        LaTeX output
        ------------
        
        LaTeX output is based on Pygments LatexFormatter, which requires custom
        style definitions to be injeced into latex document preamble. That's done by
        default, but when Sphinx ``latex_preamble`` setting is set manually, it
        should include the following::
        
           from pygments.formatters import LatexFormatter
        
           latex_elements['latex_preamble'] = '''\
           \usepackage{fancyvrb}
           \usepackage{color}
           ''' + LatexFormatter().get_style_defs()
