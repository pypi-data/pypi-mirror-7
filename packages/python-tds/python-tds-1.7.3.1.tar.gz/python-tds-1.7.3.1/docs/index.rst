Pytds - Microsoft SQL Server database adapter for Python
========================================================

Pytds is the top to bottom pure Python TDS implementation, that means cross-platform, and no dependency on ADO or FreeTDS.
It supports large parameters (>4000 characters), MARS, timezones, new date types (datetime2, date, time, datetimeoffset).
Even though it is implemented in Python performance is comparable to ADO and FreeTDS bindings.

It also supports Python 3.
