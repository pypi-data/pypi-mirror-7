   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description: Docker-Registry
        ===============
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dotcloud/docker-registry.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dotcloud/docker-registry)
        
        About this document
        ===================
        
        As the documentation evolves with different registry versions, be sure that before reading any further you do:
        
         * check which version of the registry you are running
         * switch to the corresponding tag to access the README that matches your product version
        
        The stable, released version is currently the [0.6.9 tag](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry/tree/0.6.9).
        
        
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        The fastest way to get running:
        
         * install docker according to the [following instructions](http://docs.docker.io/installation/#installation)
         * run the registry: `docker run -p 5000:5000 registry`
        
        That will use the
        [official image from the Docker index](https://index.docker.io/_/registry/).
        
        Here is another example that will launch a container on port 5000, and store images in an Amazon S3 bucket:  
        ```
        docker run \
                 -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=s3 \
                 -e AWS_BUCKET=acme-docker \
                 -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry \
                 -e AWS_KEY=AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ \
                 -e AWS_SECRET=xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T \
                 -e SEARCH_BACKEND=sqlalchemy \
                 -p 5000:5000 \
                 registry
        ```
        
        See [config_sample.yml](config/config_sample.yml) for all available environment variables.
        
        Create the configuration
        ========================
        
        The Docker Registry comes with a sample configuration file,
        `config_sample.yml`. Copy this to `config.yml` to provide a basic
        configuration:
        
        ```
        cp config/config_sample.yml config/config.yml
        ```
        
        Configuration flavors
        =====================
        
        Docker Registry can run in several flavors. This enables you to run it
        in development mode, production mode or your own predefined mode.
        
        In the `config_sample.yml` file, you'll see several sample flavors:
        
        1. `common`: used by all other flavors as base settings
        1. `local`: stores data on the local filesystem
        1. `s3`: stores data in an AWS S3 bucket
        1. `dev`: basic configuration using the `local` flavor
        1. `test`: used by unit tests
        1. `prod`: production configuration (basically a synonym for the `s3` flavor)
        1. `gcs`: stores data in Google cloud storage
        1. `swift`: stores data in OpenStack Swift
        1. `glance`: stores data in OpenStack Glance, with a fallback to local storage
        1. `glance-swift`: stores data in OpenStack Glance, with a fallback to Swift
        1. `elliptics`: stores data in Elliptics key/value storage
        
        You can define your own flavors by adding a new top-level yaml key.
        
        You can specify which flavor to run by setting `SETTINGS_FLAVOR` in your
        environment: `export SETTINGS_FLAVOR=dev`
        
        The default flavor is `dev`.
        
        NOTE: it's possible to load environment variables from the config file
        with a simple syntax: `_env:VARIABLENAME[:DEFAULT]`. Check this syntax
        in action in the example below...
        
        
        #### Example config
        
        ```yaml
        
        common:
            loglevel: info
            search_backend: "_env:SEARCH_BACKEND:"
            sqlalchemy_index_database:
                "_env:SQLALCHEMY_INDEX_DATABASE:sqlite:////tmp/docker-registry.db"
        
        prod:
            loglevel: warn
            storage: s3
            s3_access_key: _env:AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY
            s3_secret_key: _env:AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY
            s3_bucket: _env:AWS_S3_BUCKET
            boto_bucket: _env:AWS_S3_BUCKET
            storage_path: /srv/docker
            smtp_host: localhost
            from_addr: docker@myself.com
            to_addr: my@myself.com
        
        dev:
            loglevel: debug
            storage: local
            storage_path: /home/myself/docker
        
        test:
            storage: local
            storage_path: /tmp/tmpdockertmp
        ```
        
        
        Location of the config file
        ===========================
        
        ### DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG
        
        Specify the config file to be used by setting `DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG` in your
        environment: `export DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG=config.yml`
        
        The default location of the config file is `config.yml`, located in
        the `config` subdirectory.  If `DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG` is a relative
        path, that path is expanded relative to the `config` subdirectory.
        
        ### Docker image
        When building an image using the Dockerfile or using an image from the
        [Docker index](https://index.docker.io/_/registry/), the default config is
        `config_sample.yml`.
        
        It is also possible to mount the configuration file into the docker image
        
        ```
        sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 -v /home/user/registry-conf:/registry-conf -e DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG=/registry-conf/config.yml registry
        ```
        
        Available configuration options
        ===============================
        
        When using the `config_sample.yml`, you can pass all options through as environment variables. See [`config_sample.yml`](config/config_sample.yml) for the mapping.
        
        ## General options
        
        1. `loglevel`: string, level of debugging. Any of python's
           [logging](http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) module levels:
           `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `critical`
        1. `storage_redirect`: Redirect resource requested if storage engine supports
           this, e.g. S3 will redirect signed URLs, this can be used to offload the
           server.
        1. `boto_host`/`boto_port`: If you are using `storage: s3` the
           [standard boto config file locations](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html#details)
           (`/etc/boto.cfg, ~/.boto`) will be used.  If you are using a
           *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store, in one of the boto config files'
           `[Credentials]` section, set `boto_host`, `boto_port` as appropriate for the
           service you are using.
        1. `bugsnag`: The bugsnag API key
        
        ### Authentication options
        
        1. `standalone`: boolean, run the server in stand-alone mode. This means that
           the Index service on index.docker.io will not be used for anything. This
           implies `disable_token_auth`.
        
        1. `index_endpoint`: string, configures the hostname of the Index endpoint.
           This is used to verify passwords of users that log in. It defaults to
           https://index.docker.io. You should probably leave this to its default.
        
        1. `disable_token_auth`: boolean, disable checking of tokens with the Docker
           index. You should provide your own method of authentication (such as Basic
           auth).
        
        #### Privileged access
        
        1. `privileged_key`: allows you to make direct requests to the registry by using
           an RSA key pair. The value is the path to a file containing the public key.
           If it is not set, privileged access is disabled.
        
        ##### Generating keys with `openssl`
        
        You will need to install the python-rsa package (`pip install rsa`) in addition to using `openssl`.
        Generating the public key using openssl will lead to producing a key in a format not supported by 
        the RSA library the registry is using.
        
        Generate private key:
        
            openssl genrsa  -out private.pem 2048
        
        Associated public key :
        
            pyrsa-priv2pub -i private.pem -o public.pem
        
        
        ### Search-engine options
        
        The Docker Registry can optionally index repository information in a
        database for the `GET /v1/search` [endpoint][search-endpoint].  You
        can configure the backend with a configuration like:
        
        The `search_backend` setting selects the search backend to use.  If
        `search_backend` is empty, no index is built, and the search endpoint always
        returns empty results.  
        
        1. `search_backend`: The name of the search backend engine to use.
           Currently supported backends are:
           1. `sqlalchemy`
        
        
        If `search_backend` is neither empty nor one of the supported backends, it
        should point to a module.
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        common:
          search_backend: foo.registry.index.xapian
        ```
        
        #### sqlalchemy
        
        1. `sqlalchemy_index_database`: The database URL
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        common:
          search_backend: sqlalchemy
          sqlalchemy_index_database: sqlite:////tmp/docker-registry.db
        ```
        
        
        In this case, the module is imported, and an instance of it's `Index`
        class is used as the search backend.
        
        ### Mirroring Options
        
        All mirror options are placed in a `mirroring` section.
        
        1. `mirroring`:
          1. `source`:
          1. `source_index`:
          1. `tags_cache_ttl`:
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        common:
          mirroring:
            source: https://registry-1.docker.io
            source_index: https://index.docker.io
            tags_cache_ttl: 864000 # 10 days
        ```
        
        ### Cache options
        
        It's possible to add an LRU cache to access small files. In this case you need
        to spawn a [redis-server](http://redis.io/) configured in
        [LRU mode](http://redis.io/topics/config). The config file "config_sample.yml"
        shows an example to enable the LRU cache using the config directive `cache_lru`.
        
        Once this feature is enabled, all small files (tags, meta-data) will be cached
        in Redis. When using a remote storage backend (like Amazon S3), it will speeds
        things up dramatically since it will reduce roundtrips to S3.
        
        All config settings are placed in a `cache` or `cache_lru` section.
        
        1. `cache`/`cache_lru`:
          1. `host`: Host address of server
          1. `port`: Port server listens on
          1. `password`: Authentication password
        
        
        ### Email options
        
        Settings these options makes the Registry send an email on each code Exception:
        
        1. `email_exceptions`:
          1. `smtp_host`: hostname to connect to using SMTP
          1. `smtp_port`: port number to connect to using SMTP
          1. `smtp_login`: username to use when connecting to authenticated SMTP
          1. `smtp_password`: password to use when connecting to authenticated SMTP
          1. `smtp_secure`: boolean, true for TLS to using SMTP. this could be a path
                            to the TLS key file for client authentication.
          1. `from_addr`: email address to use when sending email
          1. `to_addr`: email address to send exceptions to
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        test:
            email_exceptions:
                smtp_host: localhost
        ```
        
        ## Storage options
        
        `storage` selects the storage engine to use. The registry ships with two storage engine by default (`file` and `s3`).
        
        If you want to find other (community provided) storages: `pip search docker-registry-driver`
        
        To use and install one of these alternate storages:
        
         * `pip install docker-registry-driver-NAME`
         * in the configuration set `storage` to `NAME`
         * add any other storage dependent configuraiton option to the conf file
         * review the storage specific documentation for additional dependency or configuration instructions.
        
         Currently, we are aware of the following storage driver:
        
          * [elliptics](https://github.com/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics)
          * [swift](https://github.com/bacongobbler/docker-registry-driver-swift)
          * [gcs](https://github.com/dmp42/docker-registry-driver-gcs)
          * [glance](https://github.com/dmp42/docker-registry-driver-glance)
        
        ### storage: file
        
        1. `storage_path`: Path on the filesystem where to store data
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        local:
          storage: file
          storage_path: /mnt/registry
        ```
        
        #### Persistent storage
        If you use any type of local store along with a registry running within a docker
        remember to use a data volume for the `storage_path`. Please read the documentation
        for [data volumes](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_volumes/) for more information.
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        docker run -p 5000 -v /tmp/registry:/tmp/registry registry
        ```
        
        ### storage: s3
        AWS Simple Storage Service options
        
        1. `s3_access_key`: string, S3 access key
        1. `s3_secret_key`: string, S3 secret key
        1. `s3_bucket`: string, S3 bucket name
        1. `s3_region`: S3 region where the bucket is located
        1. `s3_encrypt`: boolean, if true, the container will be encrypted on the
              server-side by S3 and will be stored in an encrypted form while at rest
              in S3.
        1. `s3_secure`: boolean, true for HTTPS to S3
        1. `boto_bucket`: string, the bucket name
        1. `storage_path`: string, the sub "folder" where image data will be stored.
        
        Example:
        ```yaml
        prod:
          storage: s3
          s3_region: us-west-1
          s3_bucket: acme-docker
          storage_path: /registry
          s3_access_key: AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ
          s3_secret_key: xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T
        ```
        
        Run the Registry
        ----------------
        
        ### Recommended: run the registry docker container
        
         * install docker according to the [following instructions](http://docs.docker.io/installation/#installation)
         * run the registry: `docker run -p 5000:5000 registry`
        
        or
        
        ```
        docker run \
                 -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=s3 \
                 -e AWS_BUCKET=acme-docker \
                 -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry \
                 -e AWS_KEY=AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ \
                 -e AWS_SECRET=xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T \
                 -e SEARCH_BACKEND=sqlalchemy \
                 -p 5000:5000 \
                 registry
        ```
        
        NOTE: The container will try to allocate the port 5000. If the port
        is already taken, find out which container is already using it by running `docker ps`
        
        ### Advanced: install the registry on an existing server
        
        #### On Ubuntu
        
        Install the system requirements for building a Python library:
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libevent-dev python-pip liblzma-dev
        ```
        
        Then install the Registry app:
        
        ```
        sudo pip install docker-registry
        ```
        
        (or clone the repository and `pip install .`)
        
        #### On Red Hat-based systems:
        
        Install the required dependencies:
        ```
        sudo yum install python-devel libevent-devel python-pip gcc xz-devel
        ```
        
        NOTE: On RHEL and CentOS you will need the
        [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repostitories enabled. Fedora
        should not require the additional repositories.
        
        Then install the Registry app:
        
        ```
        sudo python-pip install docker-registry
        ```
        
        (or clone the repository and `pip install .`)
        
        #### Run it
        
        ```
        gunicorn --access-logfile - --debug -k gevent -b 0.0.0.0:5000 -w 1 docker_registry.wsgi:application
        ```
        
        ### How do I setup user accounts?
        
        The first time someone tries to push to your registry, it will prompt
        them for a username, password, and email.
        
        ### What about a Production environment?
        
        The recommended setting to run the Registry in a prod environment is gunicorn
        behind a nginx server which supports chunked transfer-encoding (nginx >= 1.3.9).
        
        You could use for instance supervisord to spawn the registry with 8 workers
        using this command:
        
        ```
        gunicorn -k gevent --max-requests 100 --graceful-timeout 3600 -t 3600 -b localhost:5000 -w 8 docker_registry.wsgi:application
        ```
        
        #### nginx
        
        [Here is an nginx configuration file example.](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry/blob/master/contrib/nginx.conf), which applies to versions < 1.3.9 which are compiled with the [HttpChunkinModule](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpChunkinModule). 
        
        [This is another example nginx configuration file](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry/blob/master/contrib/nginx_1-3-9.conf) that applies to versions of nginx greater than 1.3.9 that have support for the chunked_transfer_encoding directive.
        
        And you might want to add
        [Basic auth on Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpAuthBasicModule) to protect it
        (if you're not using it on your local network):
        
        
        #### Apache
        
        Enable mod_proxy using `a2enmod proxy_http`, then use this snippet forward
        requests to the Docker Registry:
        
        ```
          ProxyPreserveHost  On
          ProxyRequests      Off
          ProxyPass          /  http://localhost:5000/
          ProxyPassReverse   /  http://localhost:5000/
        ```
        
        
        #### dotCloud
        
        The central Registry runs on the dotCloud platform:
        
        ```
        cd docker-registry/
        dotcloud create myregistry
        dotcloud push
        ```
