Q: Does gPlayer load images, lyrics etc. from the internet?
A: No. If you want quality, you need to get it by yourself.

Q: Where do I have to save the images?
A: In the audiofile (FLAC, MP3)

Q: Where do I have to save the lyrics?
A: Unsynced lyrics: In the audiofile (FLAC, MP3). Use the "unycnedlyrics" or "lyrics" tag.
For syncronized lyrics you could save it in the audiofile, or in the same directory as the audiofile, or you specify a relativ directory in the config-file.

Q: What is used for the comments?
A: Since different programms using different tags ("comment", "comments"), all tags that have *comment* in the name are displayed.
These tags are useful if i.e. the song features a guest-singer etc.

Q: How to restore a playlist?
A: In the config-directory (~/.gPlayer/) are stored two files: lastPlaylist.tmp and lastPlaylistNumber.tmp
lastPlaylist.tmp ist the last playlist you played (if you used the shuffle-mode, this list is shuffled).
lastPlaylistNumber.tmp only holds the number of the song from this list.
If you call the gPlayer with the "resume"-flag (-R or --resume), it starts on this position.

Q: How has a snyced-lyric-file/lrc-file to look like?
A: Timestamp and lyric-line. An example from wikipedia:
[00:12.00]Line 1 lyrics
[00:17.20]Line 2 lyrics
[00:21.10]Line 3 lyrics
...
[mm:ss.xx]last lyrics line
