First, install the dependencies (pygame and GStreamer for Python):
sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-gst0.10

Then unpack the tarball and change in the directory:
tar -xvzf dacapo-0.1.9a.tar.gz
cd dacapo-0.1.9a/

After you have done this call the setup as root user
(because setup will install the object in /usr/local/bin/):
sudo python setup.py install 

Done.

For options etc. see the manpages:
man dacapo
