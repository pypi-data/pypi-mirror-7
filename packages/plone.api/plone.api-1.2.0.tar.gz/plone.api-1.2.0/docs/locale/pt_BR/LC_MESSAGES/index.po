msgid "The intention of this package is to be transitional. It points out which parts of Plone are particularly nasty -- we wish they get fixed so we can deprecate *plone.api* methods that cover them up, but leave the documentation in place."

msgid "Some parts of documentation already are this way: they don't use *plone.api* methods directly, but simply provide guidance on achiving a task using Plone's internals. Example: usage of the catalog in :ref:`content_find_example`."

msgid "The intention is to cover 20% of tasks we do 80% of the time. Keeping everything in one place helps keep the API introspectable and discoverable, which are important aspects of being Pythonic."
