msgid "It comes with *cookbook*-like documentation with step-by-step instructions for doing common development tasks in Plone. Recipes try to assume the user does not have extensive knowledge about Plone internals."

msgid "The intention of this package is to be transitional. It points out which parts of Plone are particularly nasty -- we wish they get fixed so we can deprecate *plone.api* methods that cover them up, but leave the documentation in place."
msgstr ""

# 06641ff2a24b4115a13b19d2fb8459b4
msgid "Some parts of documentation already are this way: they don't use *plone.api* methods directly, but simply provide guidance on achiving a task using Plone's internals. Example: usage of the catalog in :ref:`content_find_example`."

msgid "The intention is to cover 20% of tasks we do 80% of the time. Keeping everything in one place helps keep the API introspectable and discoverable, which are important aspects of being Pythonic."
