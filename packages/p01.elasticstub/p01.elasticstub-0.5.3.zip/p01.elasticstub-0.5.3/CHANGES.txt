------------------

- switch to elasticsearch 0.20.1. Note; there is no need to switch to newer
  releases just for get the latest version. Simply use the downloadURL
  attribute for set a newer elasticsearch version download url

- It seems that the auto mapping doesn't work anymore by default. Added explicit
  mapping setup after inserting first item. This seems to wrk as it should.

- bugfix: adjust base url, if used with version, from git to elasticsearch
