Description: GPML2SVG is a command line and Python API for the conversion of pathways marked up         using GPML (GenMAPP Pathway Markup Language) to SVG.         The command-line interface is currently basic. Simply call the script with the name of the         GPML file to convert. The resulting SVG will be saved using the same name, with the         extension change to .svg. The resulting SVG is marked up with object identifiers,         and links to relevant databases. The python interface offers a single function call to which you can optionally provide         colouring information (for data visualisation) and links for custom XRefs.         The sofware is in development as an extension to MetaPath.
