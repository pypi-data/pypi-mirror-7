0.1a8 (2014-08-04)
==================

- Consolidated `cached_property` and `reify` decorators; removed `reify`.
- Added a find_packages() function that is similar to setuptools'
  find_packages(). This version does the "right thing" with regard to PEP 420
  namespace packages--i.e., it treats *every* directory as a package. The
  quotes around "right thing" indicate that it's debatable as to whether this
  is correct in the general case.
- util.fully_qualified_name() can now accept a module as an argument; before,
  it would blow up if a module was passed in.
- Implemented a "deferred decorator action" system that is similar to Venusian
  but much simpler. Venusian uses all kinds of frame inspection/modification
  hackery that is really hard to understand.


0.1a7 (2014-03-22)
==================

- Make `converters.as_seq_of_seq()` return a converter (it no longer directly
  takes a value to convert). This makes it consistent with the other sequence
  converters.
- Add `tangled.settings.check_required()` to the public API to indicate that
  settings tools/parsers can use it.
- Remove `processors` arg from `settings.parse_settings()`. It didn't serve any
  purpose, and its presence was confusing.
- Remove custom bdist_egg command that ensured "missing" `__init__.py` files
  weren't added. It's no longer needed since setuptools 3+ no longer does
  this.
- Bug fix: Add missing `settings` arg to `check_required()` call in
  `settings.parse_settings_file()`.
- Reenable running doctests by default when running nosetests.
- Upgrade nose from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1
- Upgrade Sphinx from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2


0.1a6 (2014-03-06)
==================

- Fix/improve package metadata.
- Add workaround for setuptools "helpfully" adding __init__.py to
  tangled namespace.


0.1a5 (2014-02-09)
==================

- Allow .py files in scaffolds to have a .template suffix. This is necessary
  for .py files that use `${var}`s that aren't inside strings. Otherwise, those
  files will cause a `SyntaxError` when the package containing the scaffold is
  installed.


0.1a4 (2014-02-06)
==================

- Add `tangled python` command
- Add -y flag to `tangled release` command (assume answer to all prompts is
  yes)
- Don't offer to push tags in `tangled release`; pushing stuff is outside the
  scope of this tool.


0.1a3 (2014-02-06)
==================

- Really fix packaging issues


0.1a2 (2014-02-05)
==================

- Fix packaging issues


0.1a1 (2014-02-05)
==================

- Initial version
