Description: =============
        aws-hostname
        =============
        
        Outputs a valid hostname for a given AWS instance
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using PIP via PyPI::
        
            pip install aws-hostname
        
        Using PIP via Github::
        
            pip install git+git://github.com/josegonzalez/python-aws-hostname.git#egg=aws-hostname
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        CLI Usage is as follows::
        
            aws-hostname [-h] [-r EC2_REGION] [-s AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
                             [-s AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY] [-i EC2_INSTANCE_ID]
        
        You can also use the equivalent environment variables in place of command arguments.
        
        This command will use the instance id and the tag ``aws:autoscaling:groupName`` to construct a valid hostname. It is useful for setting readable hostnames for autoscale groups like so::
        
            aws-hostname -r $REGION -a $ACCESS_ID -s $SECRET_KEY -i $INSTANCE_ID > /etc/hostname
            hostname -F /etc/hostname
        
        In cases where it is run against a non-autoscale group node, it will fallback to the ``Name`` attribute of the instance.
