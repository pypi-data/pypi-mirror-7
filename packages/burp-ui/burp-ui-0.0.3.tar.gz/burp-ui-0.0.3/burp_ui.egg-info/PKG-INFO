Description: Build Status
        ------------
        
        .. image:: http://ci.ziirish.me/projects/1/status.png?ref=master
            :target: http://ci.ziirish.me/projects/1?ref=master
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        For LDAP authentication (optional), we need the ``simpleldap`` module that 
        requires the following packages on Debian:
        
        ::
        
            aptitude install libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev python-dev
        
        
        Then we install the module itself:
        
        ::
        
            pip install simpleldap
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Burp-UI is written in Python with the `Flask`_ micro-framework.
        The easiest way to install Flask is to use ``pip``.
        
        On Debian, you can install ``pip`` with the following command:
        
        ::
        
            aptitude install python-pip
        
        
        Once ``pip`` is installed, you can install ``Burp-UI`` this way:
        
        ::
        
            pip install burp-ui
        
        
        You can setup various parameters in the `burpui.cfg`_ file.
        This file can be specified with the ``-c`` flag or should be present in
        ``/etc/burp/burpui.cfg``.
        By default ``Burp-UI`` ships with a default file located in
        ``$BURPUIDIR/../share/burpui/etc/burpui.cfg``.
        
        Then you can run ``burp-ui``: ``burp-ui``
        
        By default, ``burp-ui`` listens on all interfaces (including IPv6) on port 5000.
        
        You can then point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Please feel free to report any issues on my `gitlab <https://git.ziirish.me/ziirish/burp-ui/issues>`_
        I have closed the *github tracker* to have a unique tracker system.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        Here is a non-exhaustive list of things I'd like to add:
        
        * server-initiated restoration (with burp, you can create a special file that triggers a restoration when the client contacts the server the next time. In this case the client must accepts server-initiated restoration).
        * burp-server configuration front-end (so that you can configure your burp server within burp-ui).
        * More statistics.
        * etc.
        
        Also note that in the future, I'd like to write a burp-client GUI.
        But I didn't think yet of what to do.
