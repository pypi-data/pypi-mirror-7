Description: # Build Status
        
        [![build status](http://ci.ziirish.me/projects/1/status.png?ref=master)](http://ci.ziirish.me/projects/1?ref=master)
        
        # Requirements
        
        For LDAP authentication (optional), we need the `simpleldap` module that 
        requires the following packages on Debian:
        
        ```
        aptitude install libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev python-dev
        ```
        
        Then we install the module itself:
        
        ```
        pip install simpleldap
        ```
        
        # Installation
        
        Burp-UI is written in Python with the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) micro-framework.
        The easiest way to install Flask is to use `pip`.
        
        On Debian, you can install `pip` with the following command:
        
        ```
        aptitude install python-pip
        ```
        
        Once `pip` is installed, you can install `Flask` and the other requirements this
        way:
        
        ```
        pip install Flask
        pip install flask-login
        pip install WTForms
        pip install Flask-WTF
        ```
        
        Then you need to download the sources.
        
        For example:
        
        ```
        git clone http://git.ziirish.me/ziirish/burp-ui.git
        ```
        
        You can setup various parameters in the [burpui.cfg](burpui.cfg) file.
        
        Then you can run `burp-ui`: `python burp-ui.py`
        
        By default, `burp-ui` listens on all interfaces (including IPv6) on port 5000.
        
        You can then point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        
        # Notes
        
        Please feel free to report any issues on my [gitlab](https://git.ziirish.me/ziirish/burp-ui/issues)
        I have closed the *github tracker* to have a unique tracker system.
        
        # TODO
        
        Here is a non-exhaustive list of things I'd like to add:
        
        * Authentication so that only admins can access to burp stats.
        * server-initiated restoration (with burp, you can create a special file that triggers
        a restoration when the client contacts the server the next time. In this case the
        client must accepts server-initiated restoration).
        * burp-server configuration front-end (so that you can configure your burp server
        within burp-ui).
        * More statistics.
        * etc.
        
        Also note that in the future, I'd like to write a burp-client GUI.
        But I didn't think yet of what to do.
