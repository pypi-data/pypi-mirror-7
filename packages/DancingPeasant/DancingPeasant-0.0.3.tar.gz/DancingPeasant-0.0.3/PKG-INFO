Description: # DancingPeasant
        
        ## Overview
        
        This is an(other) experiment in moving away from CSV and towards SQL (specifically SQLite).
        Hopefully this will be a base class that will give me SQL-type data files with history etc and a
        means to manage adding/removing tables and validating data.
        
        Wish me luck!
