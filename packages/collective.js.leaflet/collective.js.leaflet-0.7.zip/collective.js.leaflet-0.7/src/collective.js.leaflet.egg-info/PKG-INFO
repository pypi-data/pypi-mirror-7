        Description
        ===========
        
        Enrich your Plone site with the power of Leaflet maps. Leaflet version of this package is 0.7.3.
        
        https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet
        
        This addon registers the Leaflet base Javascript and CSS resources and
        optionally some interesting Leaflet plugins. By installing this addon, the base
        Leaflet mapping resources are automatically integrated. To activate some of the
        Plugins, you have to add one of these resource bundles to your registry.xml
        Registration:

        Since this addon only provides Leaflet resources, you have finally provide some
        HTML markup for the map and write your custom Javascript integration code for
        Leaflet maps to work.
        
        You have an example view at /@@LeafletMapView.

        collective.js.leaflet Installation
        =================================================================================
        
        To install collective.js.leaflet into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
         * When you're reading this you have probably already run ::
        
           ``easy_install collective.js.leaflet``.
        
           Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
         * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
           via::
        
               python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
           into your Zope instance.
        
         * Create a file called ``collective.js.leaflet-configure.zcml`` in the
           ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
           should only contain this::
        
               <include package="collective.js.leaflet" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
         * Add ``collective.js.leaflet`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.js.leaflet
        
         * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.js.leaflet
        
         * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
