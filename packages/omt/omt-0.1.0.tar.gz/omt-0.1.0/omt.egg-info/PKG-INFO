Description: A fairly generic tool that allows you to capture all of the output from
        a terminal application (including shells). This output is then rendered in
        a pure-python terminal emulator (pyte), and the resulting virtual "screen"
        is dumped to either generic JSON or a generic HTML snippet that can then
        be used to by other tools or inserted into a webpage.
        
        There are issues with some complex curses applications that use certain
        CSI control codes not (yet) supported by pyte. For example, htop will not
        work.
        
        This tool was designed specifically to turn zsh themes into a gallery.
        
        
        Example:
        
            echo "ls\\nexit\\n" > omt-py html -- /bin/zsh
        
        
        Commands:
            omt-py json             - Generates a JSON representation of the screen.
            omt-py html             - Generates a generic HTML snippet or a standalone
                                      page.
            omt-py iterm-to-css     - Converts an iTerm2 theme into CSS suitable for
                                      usage with the HTML snippets generated by omt.
        
        Usage:
            omt-py json [options] -- <argv>...
            omt-py html [options] -- <argv>...
            omt-py iterm-to-css [--prefix=<prefix>] <source>
        
        Options:
            --width=<columns>       The number of columns for the pseudo-terminal.
                                    [default: 80]
            --height=<lines>        The number of lines for the pseudo-terminal.
                                    [default: 24]
            --standalone            When generating HTML, generate a standalone page
                                    instead of a generic snippet.
            --theme=<source>        When generating standalone HTML, use this iTerm2
                                    theme for the CSS.
            --prefix=<prefix>       The prefix to use for CSS selectors.
