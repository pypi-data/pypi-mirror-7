        Usage
        -----
        
        Follow these easy steps:
        
        1. Import the ``webhook`` decorator.
        2. Define a function that returns a JSON-serializable dictionary or iterable.
        3. Add the ``webhook`` decorator and pass in a ``sender_callable``.
        4. Call the function!
        
        Synchronous example (async examples to come soon):
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from webhooks import webhook
            from webhooks.senders import targeted
        
            @webhook(sender_callable=targeted.sender)
            def basic(url, wife, husband):
                return {"husband": husband, "wife": wife}
        
            basic(url="http://httpbin.org/post", "Danny", "Audrey")
