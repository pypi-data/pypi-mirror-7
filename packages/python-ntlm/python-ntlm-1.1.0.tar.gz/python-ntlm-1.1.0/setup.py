      This package allows Python clients running on any operating
      system to provide NTLM authentication to a supporting server.
      
      python-ntlm is probably most useful on platforms that are not
      Windows, since on Windows it is possible to take advantage of
      platform-specific NTLM support.

      This is also useful for passing hashes to servers requiring
      ntlm authentication in instances where using windows tools is 
      not desirable.""",
