Intro
=====

`requests-mock` provides a building block to stub out the HTTP `requests`_ portions of your testing code.

The Basics
==========

Everything in `requests`_ eventually goes through an adapter to do the transport work.
`requests-mock` creates a custom `adatper` that allows you to predefine responses when certain URIs are called.

There are then a number of methods provided to get the adapter used.

A simple example:

.. code:: python

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock

    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adater()
    >>> session.mount('mock', adapter)

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com', text='data')
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com')
    >>> resp.status_code, resp.text
    (200, 'data')

Obviously having all URLs be `mock://` prefixed isn't going to useful, so there are a number of ways to get the adapter into place.
