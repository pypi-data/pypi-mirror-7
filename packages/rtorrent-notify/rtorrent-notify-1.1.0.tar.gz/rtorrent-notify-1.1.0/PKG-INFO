        Description
        -----------
        
        rtorrent-notify aims to be a very simple tool to notify users of rtorrent-related events.
        It can actually be used for other kind of events, being mostly generic.
        
        Running
        -------
        
        If installed, you can run ``rtorrent-notify``.
        Otherwise, you can start it with ``python -m rtorrentnotify``.
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        If you upgrade from rtorrent2rss, the event database will get erased because of format incompatibilities.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - PyRSS2Gen
        - argparse (or Python 2.7)
        - An `irkerd <http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/>`_ server running on localhost (optional, only if you want IRC notifications)
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Add this to your .rtorrent.rc::
        
            system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,rtnfy_finished,"execute=rtorrent-notify,FINISH,$d.get_base_path="
            system.method.set_key = event.download.inserted_new,rtnfy_inserted,"execute=~/rtorrent-notify/rtorrent-notify,INSERT,$d.get_name="
        
        For older versions of rtorrent (pre 0.8.4)::
        
            on_finished = rtnfy_finished,"execute=rtorrent-notify,FINISH,$d.get_base_path="
            on_start = rtnfy_started,"execute=rtorrent-notify,START,$d.get_name="
        
        Unless you specify their location, the files (``rtorrent-notify.db`` and ``rtorrent-notify.xml``) will be written in the home directory. Start ``rtorrent-notify -h`` for more details.
        
        ``FINISH`` and ``START`` are just strings, you can change them.
        
        Some tips:
        
        - There are other events you might be interested in. As there is no documentation, you can try to grep for ``event.`` in rtorrent's source code.
        - ``get_base_path`` doesn't work with the "inserted" event, you can use ``get_name`` instead.
        - You will find a list of properties to use in ``ui/download.cc``
        
        Complete help for the rtorrent-notify command is available by running ``rtorrent-notify -h``.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Advanced usage with some options would be::
        
            "execute=rtorrent-notify,-r,~/public_html/feed.xml,-n,irc://chat.freenode.net/mynick,FINISH,$d.get_base_path="
        
        - The target RSS feed is changed from the default.
        - This also sends a notification to the freenode nick ``mynick``. ``-n`` is used instead of -i ``irc://chat.freenode.net/mynick,isnick`` as the ``,`` character is already used by rtorrent's config.
        - Notifications to channels could be sent by ``-i irc://chat.freenode.net/mychannel``.
