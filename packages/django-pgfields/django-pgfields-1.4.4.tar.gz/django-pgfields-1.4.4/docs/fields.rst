Simple Fields
=============

django-pgfields exposes several new fields corresponding to data types
available in PostgreSQL that are not available in other databases
supported by Django.

These fields are available on the ``django_pg.models`` module
(see :doc:`usage` for more on this).

Array Field
-----------

PostgreSQL supports an array datatype. This is most similar to arrays in
many statically-typed languages such as C or Java, in that you explicitly
declare that you want an array of a specific type (for instance, an array
of integers or an array of strings).

django-pgfields exposes this by having the array field accept another field
as its initial argument (or, alternatively, by using the ``of`` keyword
argument).::

    from django_pg import models

    class Hobbit(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        favorite_foods = models.ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=100))
        created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

This will create an array of strings in the database (to be precise:
``character varying(100) []``). Assignment of values is done using standard
Python lists::

    pippin = Hobbit.objects.create(
        name='Peregrin Took',
        favorite_foods=['apples', 'lembas bread', 'potatoes'],
    )

As a note, do not attempt to store a full list of any hobbit's favorite foods.
Your database server does not have sufficient memory or swap space for such
a list.

Lookups
^^^^^^^

When looking up data against an array field, the field supports three
lookup types: ``exact`` (implied), ``contains``, and ``len``.

**exact**

The ``exact`` lookup type is the implied lookup type when doing a lookup
in the Django ORM, and does not need to be explicitly specified. A straight
lookup simply checks for array equality. Continuing the example immediately
above::

    >>> hobbit = Hobbit.objects.get(
        favorite_foods=['apples', 'lembas bread', 'potatoes'],
    )
    >>> hobbit.name
    'Peregrin Took'

**contains**

The ``contains`` lookup type checks to see whether *all* of the provided
values exist in the array. If you only need to check for a single value,
and the value is not itself an array (in a nested case, for instance), you
may specify the lookup value directly::

    >>> hobbit = Hobbit.objects.get(favorite_foods__contains='apples')
    >>> hobbit.name
    'Peregrin Took'

If you choose to do a ``contains`` lookup on multiple values, then be aware
that *order is not relevant*. The database will check to ensure that each
value is present, but ignore order of values in the array altogether::

    >>> hobbit = Hobbit.objects.get(
        favorite_foods__contains=['lembas bread', 'apples'],
    )
    >>> hobbit.name
    'Peregrin Took'

**len**

.. versionmodified:: 1.4.3

The ``len`` lookup type checks the *length of* the array, rather than its
contents. It maps to the array_length_ function in PostgreSQL (with the second
argument set to ``1``).

Such lookups are simple and straightforward::

    >>> hobbit = Hobbit.objects.get(favorite_foods__len=3)
    >>> hobbit.name
    'Peregrin Took'

.. warning::

    In versions of django-pgfields prior to 1.4.3, using ``0`` as a value
    here was broken; it is fixed in 1.4.3.


JSON Field
----------

.. versionadded:: 0.9.2

PostgreSQL 9.2 added initial support for a JSON data type. If you wish to
store JSON natively in PostgreSQL, use the JSONField field::

    from django_pg import models

    class Dwarf(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        data = models.JSONField()
        created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

If you're using a version of PostgreSQL earlier than 9.2, this field will
fall back to the ``text`` data type.

.. warning::
    
    As of PostgreSQL 9.2, *storing* JSON is fully supported, but doing
    any useful kind of lookup (including direct equality) on it is not.
    
    As such, django-pgfields supports storing JSON data, and will return
    the JSON fields' data to you when you lookup a record by other means,
    but it does *not* support *any* kind of lookup against JSON fields.
    Attempting *any* lookup will raise TypeError.

Options
^^^^^^^

The JSON field implements the following field options in addition to
the field options `available to all fields`_.

**type**

.. versionadded:: 1.4

The ``type`` option adds an additional requirement that any value sent
to this field must be of that type. The default is ``None``, which will
allow any type that is JSON-serializable.

Usage looks like::

    data = models.JSONField(type=dict)

Acceptable values for this option are: ``dict``, ``list``, ``str``/``unicode``
(see below), ``int``, ``float``, and ``bool``.

The common use case for this option is to allow code to expect a particular
type of value from this field (``dict`` is the most common need).

If you specify this option, an appropriate empty ``default`` value of that
type will automatically be set. Therefore, the example above is exactly
equivalent to::

    data = models.JSONField(type=dict, default={})

.. note::

    If you want to require a string value (to be honest, I can't think of
    any reason to do this rather than just use ``TextField``), you'll need
    to specify the correct text type for the version of Python you're using.
    If you're on Python 3, use ``str``; if you're on Python 2, use ``unicode``.

Values
^^^^^^

The JSON field will return values back to you in the Python equivalents
of the native JavaScript types:

* JavaScript ``number`` instances will be converted to ``int`` or ``float``
  as appropriate.
* JavaScript ``array`` instances will be converted to Python ``list`` instances,
  and value conversion will be recursively applied to every item in the list.
* JavaScript ``object`` instances will be converted to Python ``dict``,
  and value conversion will be recursively applied to the keys and values
  of the dictionary.
* JavaScript ``string`` instances will be converted to Python 3 ``str``.
* JavaScript ``boolean`` instances will be converted to Python ``bool``.
* JavaScript ``null`` is converted to Python ``None``.
* JavaScript special values (``NaN``, ``Infinity``) are converted to their
  Python equivalents. Use ``math.isnan`` and ``math.isinf`` to test for them.

.. note::

    Because field subclasses are called to convert values over and over again,
    there are a few cases where the conversion is not idempotent. In
    particular, strings that are also valid JSON (or look sufficiently close
    to valid JSON) will be deserialized again.

The short version: write Python dictionaries, lists, and scalars, and
the JSON field will figure out what to do with it.

UUID Field
----------

In order to store UUIDs in the database under the PostgreSQL UUID type,
use the UUIDField field::

    from django_pg import models

    class Elf(models.Model):
        id = models.UUIDField(auto_add=True, primary_key=True)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

Options
^^^^^^^

The UUID field implements the following field options in addition to
the field options `available to all fields`_.

.. note::

    The UUID field interprets and writes blank values as SQL ``NULL``.
    Therefore, setting ``blank=True`` requires ``null=True`` also.
    Setting the former but not the latter will raise ``AttributeError``.


**auto_add**

.. versionmodified:: 1.4

Normally, the UUIDField works like any other Field subclass; you are
expected to provide a value, and the value is saved to the database directly.

If ``auto_add=True`` is set, then explicitly providing a value becomes
optional. If no value is provided, then the field will auto-generate a
random `version 4 UUID`_, which will be saved to the database (and assigned
to the model instance).

This is a particularly useful construct if you wish to store UUIDs for
primary keys; they're a completely acceptable substitute for auto-incrementing
integers::

    >>> legolas = Elf(name='Legolas Greenleaf')
    >>> legolas.id
    ''
    >>> legolas.save()
    >>> legolas.id
    UUID('b1f12115-3337-4ec0-acb9-1bcf63e44477')

As of django-pgfields 1.4, it is *also* possible to use ``auto_add`` to
generate a UUID using an algorithm other than ``uuid.uuid4``.  Instead of
sending in ``True``, send in any callable which takes no arguments and
reliably returns a UUID.

For instance, the following field instantiation would cause a version 1 UUID
to be used instead::

    from django_pg import models
    import uuid

    id = models.UUID(auto_add=uuid.uuid1, primary_key=True)

**coerce_to**

.. versionadded:: 1.2

By default, the ``to_python`` method on ``UUIDField`` will coerce values
to UUID objects. Setting this option will use a different class constructor
within ``to_python``.

The general use-case for this is if you want to get strings instead of
UUID objects. The following example would be the output in the case that
you assigned ``coerce_to=str``::

    >>> legolas = Elf(name='Legolas Greenleaf')
    >>> legolas.save()
    >>> legolas.id
    'b1f12115-3337-4ec0-acb9-1bcf63e44477'

Values
^^^^^^

The UUID field will return values from the database as Python `UUID`_
objects.

If you choose to do so, you may assign a valid string to the field. The
string will be converted to a ``uuid.UUID`` object upon assignment
to the instance::

    >>> legolas = Elf(name='Legolas Greenleaf')
    >>> legolas.id = '01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-0123456789ab'
    >>> legolas.id
    UUID('01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-0123456789ab')
    >>> type(legolas.id)
    <class 'uuid.UUID'>

Lookups can be performed using either strings or Python UUID objects.
