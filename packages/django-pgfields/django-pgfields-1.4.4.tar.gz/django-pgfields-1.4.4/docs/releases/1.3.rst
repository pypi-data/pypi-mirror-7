===================
django-pgfields 1.3
===================

Welcome to django-pgfields 1.3!

Overview
--------

This release builds on django-pgfields by adding support for automatically
generated UUID primary keys on most models, as well as a more convenient
way to specify ``select_related`` and ``prefetch_related``.


Features
--------

* django-pgfields now defines a ``DJANGOPG_DEFAULT_UUID_PK`` setting. If set
  to ``True`` (the default is ``False``), it will cause most models
  created with no explicitly-specified primary key to get a UUID primary
  key field, rather than an auto-incrementing primary key.
* django-pgfields now builds on Django's default ``Model`` by adding support
  for ``select_related`` and ``prefetch_related`` to be specified as options
  on the ``Meta`` inner class.
