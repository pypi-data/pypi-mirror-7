===================
django-pgfields 1.4
===================

Welcome to django-pgfields 1.4!

Overview
--------

This release builds on django-pgfields by adding support for requiring
a specific type on ``JSONField``, and for allowing arbitrary callables
for generating UUIDs automatically on ``UUIDField``.


Features
--------

* The ``JSONField`` class now allows you to send a ``type`` argument, along
  with a class that is JSON serializable, such as ``dict`` or ``list``.
  Use this to require that the root value of a JSONField always be a
  particular type.
* The ``UUIDField`` class now accepts a callable as the value of
  ``auto_add`` (sending ``True`` still works). If specified, this callable
  will be used to generate new UUIDs.  Any callable that takes no arguments
  and reliably returns a UUID is acceptable.


Minor Releases
--------------

* As of 1.4.2, django-pgfields ships with a ``DateTimeField`` subclass
  that accepts UNIX timestamps as values (and otherwise behaves exactly
  like its parent, the stock Django class).
* As of 1.4.3, sending a query to an ``ArrayField`` with a ``__len`` and
  value of `0` works. This was broken in prior releases because it requires
  special query handling in PostgreSQL (which expects a ``NULL`` value).
