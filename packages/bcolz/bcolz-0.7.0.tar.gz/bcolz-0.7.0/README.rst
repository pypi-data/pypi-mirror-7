bcolz: columnar and compressed data containers
==============================================

**Note:** This is a renaming of the original **carray** project.

bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers.  Column
storage allows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of
columns.  It also allows for cheap addition and removal of column.  In
addition, bcolz objects are compressed by default for reducing
memory/disk I/O needs.  The compression process is carried out
internally by Blosc, a high-performance compressor that is optimized
for binary data.

bcolz can use numexpr internally so as to accelerate many vector and
query operations (although it can use pure NumPy for doing so too).
numexpr can use optimize the memory usage and use several cores for
doing the computations, so it is blazing fast.  Moreover, with the
introduction of a carray/ctable disk-based container (in version 0.5),
it can be used for doing out-of-core computations transparently.

Together, bcolz and the Blosc compressor, are finally fullfilling the
promise of accelerating memory I/O, at least for some real scenarios:

Rational
--------

By using compression, you can deal with more data using the same
amount of memory.  In case you wonder: which is the price to pay in
terms of performance? you should know that nowadays memory access is
the most common bottleneck in many computational scenarios, and CPUs
spend most of its time waiting for data, and having data compressed in
memory can reduce the stress of the memory subsystem.

In other words, the ultimate goal for bcolz is not only reducing the
memory needs of large arrays, but also making bcolz operations to go
faster than using a traditional ndarray object from NumPy.  That is
already the case for some special cases now, but will happen more
generally in a short future, when bcolz will be able to take advantage
of newer CPUs integrating more cores and wider vector units.

Requisites
----------

- Python >= 2.6
- NumPy >= 1.7
- Cython >= 0.20
- Blosc >= 1.3.0 (optional, as the internal Blosc will be used by default)
- unittest2 (optional, only in the case you are running Python 2.6)

Building
--------

Assuming that you have the requisites and a C compiler installed, do::

  $ pip install -U bcolz

or, if you have unpacked the tarball locally::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

In case you have Blosc installed as an external library you can link
with it (disregarding the included Blosc sources) in a couple of ways:

Using an environment variable::

  $ BLOSC_DIR=/usr/local     (or "set BLOSC_DIR=\blosc" on Win)
  $ export BLOSC_DIR         (not needed on Win)
  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Using a flag::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace --blosc=/usr/local

Testing
-------

After compiling, you can quickly check that the package is sane by
running::

  $ PYTHONPATH=.   (or "set PYTHONPATH=." on Windows)
  $ export PYTHONPATH    (not needed on Windows)
  $ python -c"import bcolz; bcolz.test()"  # add `heavy=True` if desired

Installing
----------

Install it as a typical Python package::

  $ python setup.py install

Documentation
-------------

You can find the online manual at:

http://bcolz.blosc.org

but of course, you can always access docstrings from the console
(i.e. help(bcolz.ctable)).

Also, you may want to look at the bench/ directory for some examples
of use.
