    ./build_inplace

Microsoft Windows (with Visual Studio 2008):

Microsoft Windows (with MinGW, not recommended):

::

    (MinGW and MSYS need to be installed)
    ./build_inplace --compiler=mingw32


Running the test suite
======================

There are several ways of running the test ruite:

- Run the test with the current Python interpreter:

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``nosetests -v -w tests/``

- Use Tox to run the test suite in several virtualenvs with several interpreters

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``tox -e py26,py27,py32`` this will run the test suite
  on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 (you'll need to have them installed beforehand)
