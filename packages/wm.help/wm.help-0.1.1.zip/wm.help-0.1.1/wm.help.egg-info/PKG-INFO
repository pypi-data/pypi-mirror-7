Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        wm.help provides infrastructure to add a help/documentation system to your plonesite
        that is based on restructured text files.
        
        It registers a browser page ``plone/@@help`` that lists all packages
        that provide help/documentation and displays the resturctured text
        rendered as html.
        
        `wm.help` is a great way to provide `up to date` documentation on how to
        complete certain tasks (eg manage images of the carousel on the front page)
        to users of the portal.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        In your package create a directory that contains the documentation.
        
        One document is the index document that either contains all documentation or links to other documentation files.
        
        See wm.help.example for documentation on how to write your own help plugin.
        
        
        TODOS
        =====
        
        easier plugin registration
            register resourceDir and docPackage automatically with the plugin
        
            (by providing a zcml directive similar to raptus.article.core.zcml)
            this requires all rst files to reside directly in the package
            the plugin is located in and all images to reside in a folder named img)
        
        
        fix regex for images to handle directives that use options too
        
        support for placeholders in links
            (eg. ``{{portal}}``, ``{{index}}``, ``{{plugin}}/my.plugin.name``)
        
        use a separate permision to access help
