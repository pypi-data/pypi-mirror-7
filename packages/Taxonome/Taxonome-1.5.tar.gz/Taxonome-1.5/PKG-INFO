Description: Taxonome is a set of tools for working with information on biological taxa.
        
        In particular, it handles scientific names, and can match the names found in a
        dataset to a given synonymy, taking into account spelling differences, synonyms
        and homonyms.
        
        It also includes functions to standardise species distribution information to the
        regions defined by the `Taxonomic Diversity Working Group (TDWG)
        <http://www.kew.org/science-research-data/kew-in-depth/gis/resources-and-publications/data/tdwg/index.htm>`_.
        
        Taxonome includes a GUI interface for working with collections of taxa. This
        requires `PyQt4 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt>`_.
