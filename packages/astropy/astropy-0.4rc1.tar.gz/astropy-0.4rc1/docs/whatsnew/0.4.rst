What's New in Astropy 0.4?
==========================

Overview
--------

Astropy 0.4 is a major release that adds new functionality since the 0.3.x
series of releases. One new sub-package is included (see `SAMP`_), and many
new features have been implemented in the existing sub-pacakges, a few of
which are described below. In addition to usability improvements, we have
made a number of changes in the infrastructure for setting up/installing the
package, and for the configuration system (see `astropy-helpers`_ and
`Configuration`_).

SAMP
----

The :ref:`vo-samp` sub-package is a new sub-package (adapted from the `SAMPy
package <http://packages.python.org/sampy/>`_) that contains an
implementation of the `Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP)
<http://www.ivoa.net/documents/SAMP/>`_ standard that allows communication
with any SAMP-enabled application (such as `TOPCAT
<http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/>`_, `SAO Ds9
<http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9>`_, and `Aladin
<http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr>`_). This sub-package includes both classes for a
hub and a client, as well as an *integrated client* which automatically
starts up a hub and acts as a client::

    >>> from astropy.vo.samp import SAMPIntegratedClient
    >>> client = SAMPIntegratedClient()
    >>> client.connect()

We can then use the client to communicate with other clients::

    >>> client.get_registered_clients()
    ['hub', 'c1', 'c2']
    >>> client.get_metadata('c1')
    {'author.affiliation': 'Astrophysics Group, Bristol University',
     'author.email': 'm.b.taylor@bristol.ac.uk',
     'author.name': 'Mark Taylor',
     'home.page': 'http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/',
     'samp.description.text': 'Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables',
     'samp.documentation.url': 'http://127.0.0.1:2525/doc/sun253/index.html',
     'samp.icon.url': 'http://127.0.0.1:2525/doc/images/tc_sok.gif',
     'samp.name': 'topcat',
     'topcat.version': '4.0-1'}

and we can then send for example tables and images over SAMP to other
applications (see :ref:`vo-samp` for examples of how to do this).

Inspecting FITS headers from the command line
---------------------------------------------

The :ref:`astropy-io-fits` sub-package now provides a command line script for
inspecting the header(s) of a FITS file. With Astropy 0.4 installed, run
``fitsheader file.fits`` in your terminal to print the header information to
the screen in a human-readable format. Run ``fitsheader --help`` to see the
full usage documentation.

Documentation/Sphinx extension changes
--------------------------------------

Starting in v0.4, astropy documentation will now show the full name of functions
and classes prefixed by the intended user-facing location.  This is in contrast
to previous versions, which pointed to the actual implementation module, rather
than the intended public API location.

This will affect URLs pointing to specific documentation pages.  For example,
this URL points to the v0.3 location of the
`astropy.cosmology.luminosity_distance` function:
http://docs.astropy.org/en/v0.3/api/astropy.cosmology.funcs.luminosity_distance.html
while the appropriate URL for v0.4 and later is:
http://docs.astropy.org/en/v0.4/api/astropy.cosmology.luminosity_distance.html

astropy-helpers
---------------

We have now extracted our set-up and documentation utilities into a separate
package, `astropy-helpers <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-helpers>`_. In
practice, this does not change anything from a user point of view, but it is
a big internal change that will allow any other packages to benefit from the
set-up utilies developed for the core package without having to first install
astropy.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration framework has been re-factored. If you have previously
edited the astropy configuration file (typically located in
``~/.astropy/config/astropy.cfg``) then you should read over
:ref:`config-0-4-transition` in order to understand how to update it
to the new mechanism.

Deprecation and backward-incompatible changes
---------------------------------------------

- ``Quantity`` comparisons with ``==`` or ``!=`` now always return ``True``
  or ``False``, even if units do not match (for which case a ``UnitsError``
  used to be raised).  [#2328]

- The functional interface for `astropy.cosmology` (e.g.
  ``cosmology.H(0.5)`` is now deprecated in favor of the objected-oriented
  approach (``WMAP9.H(0.5)``). [#2343]

- The `astropy.coordinates` package has undergone large changes for implementing the
  `APE5 <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE5.rst>`_ plan
  for the package.  Pre-v0.4 coordinates may no longer work, and should be
  adapted to the new framework.  From this point on, major changes to the
  coordinates classes are not expected.  [#2422]

Note on future versions
-----------------------

While the current release supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.1 to 3.4, the next
release (1.0) will drop support for Python 3.1 and 3.2.
