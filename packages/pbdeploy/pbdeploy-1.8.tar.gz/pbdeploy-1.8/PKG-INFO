Summary: pbdeploy (port-based deploy) is a script that handles starting, reloading and stopping your server processes, without requiring a daemon or pidfiles. It also supports running scripts before and after certain services are loaded, such as installing requirements, performing database migrations, and running tests, to make continuous deployment a breeze.
