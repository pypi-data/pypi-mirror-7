        Module for simplified usage of the Responsys Interact API.
        
        This Python package was created to fill the need for a simplified Python
        interface to the Responsys Interact web services for our latest version
        of the software.
        
        SOAP Web Services can be a bit tricky to deal with, especially for 
        Responsys Interact if the developer does not have experience with terms
        that are specific to Responsys and/or marketing. This package is geared
        to help an experienced developer get the ball rolling with minimal
        knowledge of the Responsys Interact API and UI.
        
        The Interact API is limited in comparison to the features offered through
        the web UI, but offers everything you would need to create a website that
        integrates with services offered by Responsys. There is no way to 
        dynamically create an email campaign through code, but you will be able to
        launch them dynamically using this API. 
        
        Example use case::
        
                #!/usr/bin/env python
                from interact import Interact6
                api = Interact6()
                api.connect(username='user', password='pass', pod=5)
                api.merge_into_list('folder/listname', [{
                        'EMAIL_ADDRESS_': ...,
                        'CUSTOMER_ID_': ...,
                }, { ... }, ...])
                api.trigger_campaign('folder/campaign_name', 'folder/list_name', [{
                        'EMAIL_ADDRESS_': ...,
                        'OPTIONAL_DATA1': ...,
                        'OPTIONAL_DATA2': ...,
                }, ... ])
                api.disconnect()
        
        It's also possible to create a file at ~/.interact/creds.py with saved credentials.
        
        The format of the credentials file::
            credentials = {
                '5': {
                    'username': 'apiuser',
                    'password': 'pass123',
                 },
            }
        
        Use '5' if your endpoint is ws5.*, 2 for ws2.*
        
        Then you connect simply with::
            
                #!/usr/bin/env python
                from interact import Interact6
                api = Interact6()
                api.connect(pod=5)
        
        If a file in ~/.interact/rc.py exists, it will execfile that when
        creating an instance of Interact6 unless kward exec_rc is set to False.
        This allows you to create simple campaign or program configs so that you
        do not need to hardcode paths to Interact objects.
