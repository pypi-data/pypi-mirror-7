Example app
===========

We'll be building a simple "twitter"-like site.  The source code for the example
can be found in the ``examples/twitter`` directory.  You can also `browse the source-code <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/tree/master/examples/twitter>`_
on github.

The example app uses the `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ web framework which is
very easy to get started with.  If you don't have flask already, you will need to
install it to run the example:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install flask


Running the example
-------------------

.. image:: tweepee.jpg

After ensuring that flask is installed, ``cd`` into the twitter example directory and
execute the ``run_example.py`` script:

.. code-block:: console

    python run_example.py

The example app will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/


Diving into the code
--------------------

For simplicity all example code is contained within a single module, ``examples/twitter/app.py``.

Models
^^^^^^

In the spirit of the ur-python web framework, django, peewee uses declarative model
definitions.  If you're not familiar with django, the idea is that you declare
a class with some members which map directly to the database schema.  For the
twitter clone, there are just three models:

``User``:
    represents a user account and stores the username and password, an email
    address for generating avatars using *gravatar*, and a datetime field
    indicating when that account was created

``Relationship``:
    this is a "utility model" that contains two foreign-keys to
    the ``User`` model and represents *"following"*.

``Message``:
    analagous to a tweet. this model stores the text content of
    the message, when it was created, and who posted it (foreign key to User).

If you like UML, this is basically what it looks like:

.. image:: schema.jpg


Here is what the "bare-bones" model definitions look like:

.. code-block:: python

    # create a peewee database instance -- our models will use this database to
    # persist information
    database = SqliteDatabase(DATABASE)

    # model definitions -- the standard "pattern" is to define a base model class
    # that specifies which database to use.  then, any subclasses will automatically
    # use the correct storage.
    class BaseModel(Model):
        class Meta:
            database = database

    # the user model specifies its fields (or columns) declaratively, like django
    class User(BaseModel):
        username = CharField()
        password = CharField()
        email = CharField()
        join_date = DateTimeField()

        class Meta:
            order_by = ('username',)

    # this model contains two foreign keys to user -- it essentially allows us to
    # model a "many-to-many" relationship between users.  by querying and joining
    # on different columns we can expose who a user is "related to" and who is
    # "related to" a given user
    class Relationship(BaseModel):
        from_user = ForeignKeyField(User, related_name='relationships')
        to_user = ForeignKeyField(User, related_name='related_to')


    # a dead simple one-to-many relationship: one user has 0..n messages, exposed by
    # the foreign key.  because we didn't specify, a users messages will be accessible
    # as a special attribute, User.message_set
    class Message(BaseModel):
        user = ForeignKeyField(User)
        content = TextField()
        pub_date = DateTimeField()

        class Meta:
            order_by = ('-pub_date',)

.. note::
    Note that we create a "BaseModel" class that simply defines what database
    we would like to use.  All other models then extend this class and will also
    use the correct database connection.


peewee supports :ref:`a number of field types <fields>` which map to different
column types commonly supported by database engines.  Conversion between python
types and those used in the database is handled transparently, including things like:

* boolean values
* datetimes
* decimal values
* ``NULL`` and ``None``


Creating the initial tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to start using the models, its necessary to create the tables.  This is
a one-time operation and can be done quickly using the interactive interpreter.
I created a small function in the app module to create the tables.  It looks like
this:

.. code-block:: python

    def create_tables():
        User.create_table()
        Relationship.create_table()
        Message.create_table()


Open a python shell in the directory alongside the example app and execute the
following:


.. code-block:: python

    >>> from app import *
    >>> create_tables()

.. note::
    If you encounter an ``ImportError`` it means that either "flask" or "peewee"
    was not found on your pythonpath and may not be installed correctly.  Check
    the :ref:`installation` docs on how to install peewee.


Every model has a :py:meth:`~Model.create_table` classmethod which runs a ``CREATE TABLE``
statement in the database.  It will create the table, including all columns, foreign-key
constaints, and indexes.  Usually this is something you'll only do once, whenever a new
model is added.

.. note::
    Adding fields after the table has been created will required you to
    either drop the table and re-create it or manually add the columns using ``ALTER TABLE``.

.. note::
    If you want, you can use instead write ``User.create_table(True)`` and it will
    fail silently if the table already exists.


Establishing a database connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have noticed in the above model code that there is a class defined on the
base model named ``Meta`` that sets the ``database`` attribute.  peewee
allows every model to specify which database it uses.

This is a peewee idiom:

.. code-block:: python

    # config
    DATABASE = 'tweepee.db'

    # create a database instance that will manage the connection and execute queries
    database = SqliteDatabase(DATABASE) # tell our models to use "tweepee.db"

Because sqlite likes to have a separate connection per-thread, we will tell
flask that during the request/response cycle we need to create a connection to
the database.  Flask provides some handy decorators to make this a snap:

.. code-block:: python

    @app.before_request
    def before_request():
        g.db = database
        g.db.connect()

    @app.after_request
    def after_request(response):
        g.db.close()
        return response

.. note::
    We're storing the db on the magical variable ``g`` - that's a
    flask-ism and can be ignored as an implementation detail.  The meat of this code
    is in the idea that we connect to our db every request and close that connection
    every response.  Django does the `exact same thing <http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/tags/releases/1.2.3/django/db/__init__.py#L80>`_.


Making queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ``User`` model there are a few instance methods that encapsulate some
user-specific functionality, i.e.

* ``following()``: who is this user following?
* ``followers()``: who is following this user?

These methods are rather similar in their implementation but with one key
difference:

.. code-block:: python

    def following(self):
        # query other users through the "relationship" table
        return User.select().join(
            Relationship, on=Relationship.to_user,
        ).where(Relationship.from_user == self)

    def followers(self):
        return User.select().join(
            Relationship, on=Relationship.from_user,
        ).where(Relationship.to_user == self)

.. note:
    ``on=Relationship.to_user``.  Because there are two foreign keys to ``User``, peewee
    will automatically assume the first one, which happens to be ``from_user``.


The queries end up looking like:

.. code-block:: sql

    # following:
    SELECT t1."id", t1."username", t1."password", t1."email", t1."join_date"
    FROM "user" AS t1
    INNER JOIN "relationship" AS t2
        ON t1."id" = t2."to_user_id"  # <-- joining on to_user_id
    WHERE t2."from_user_id" = ?
    ORDER BY t1."username" ASC

    # followers
    SELECT t1."id", t1."username", t1."password", t1."email", t1."join_date"
    FROM user AS t1
    INNER JOIN relationship AS t2
        ON t1."id" = t2."from_user_id"  # <-- joining on from_user_id
    WHERE t2."to_user_id" = ?
    ORDER BY t1."username" ASC


Creating new objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So what happens when a new user wants to join the site?  Looking at the
business end of the ``join()`` view, we can that it does a quick check to see
if the username is taken, and if not executes a :py:meth:`~Model.create`.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        # use the .get() method to quickly see if a user with that name exists
        user = User.get(User.username == request.form['username'])
        flash('That username is already taken')
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        # if not, create the user and store the form data on the new model
        user = User.create(
            username=request.form['username'],
            password=md5(request.form['password']).hexdigest(),
            email=request.form['email'],
            join_date=datetime.datetime.now()
        )

        # mark the user as being 'authenticated' by setting the session vars
        auth_user(user)
        return redirect(url_for('homepage'))

Much like the :py:meth:`~Model.create` method, all models come with a built-in method called
:py:meth:`~Model.get_or_create` which is used when one user follows another:

.. code-block:: python

    Relationship.get_or_create(
        from_user=session['user'], # <-- the logged-in user
        to_user=user, # <-- the user they want to follow
    )


Doing subqueries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are logged-in and visit the twitter homepage, you will see tweets from
the users that you follow.  In order to implement this, it is necessary to do
a subquery:

.. code-block:: python

    # python code
    messages = Message.select().where(
        Message.user << user.following()
    )

Results in the following SQL query:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT t1."id", t1."user_id", t1."content", t1."pub_date"
    FROM "message" AS t1
    WHERE t1."user_id" IN (
        SELECT t2."id"
        FROM "user" AS t2
        INNER JOIN "relationship" AS t3
            ON t2."id" = t3."to_user_id"
        WHERE t3."from_user_id" = ?
        ORDER BY t1."username" ASC
    )

peewee supports doing subqueries on any :py:class:`ForeignKeyField` or :py:class:`PrimaryKeyField`.

What else is of interest here?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a couple other neat things going on in the example app that are worth
mentioning briefly.

* Support for paginating lists of results is implemented in a simple function called
  ``object_list`` (after it's corollary in Django).  This function is used by all
  the views that return lists of objects.

  .. code-block:: python

      def object_list(template_name, qr, var_name='object_list', **kwargs):
          kwargs.update(
              page=int(request.args.get('page', 1)),
              pages=qr.count() / 20 + 1
          )
          kwargs[var_name] = qr.paginate(kwargs['page'])
          return render_template(template_name, **kwargs)

* Simple authentication system with a ``login_required`` decorator.  The first
  function simply adds user data into the current session when a user successfully
  logs in.  The decorator ``login_required`` can be used to wrap view functions,
  checking for whether the session is authenticated and if not redirecting to the
  login page.

  .. code-block:: python

      def auth_user(user):
          session['logged_in'] = True
          session['user'] = user
          session['username'] = user.username
          flash('You are logged in as %s' % (user.username))

      def login_required(f):
          @wraps(f)
          def inner(*args, **kwargs):
              if not session.get('logged_in'):
                  return redirect(url_for('login'))
              return f(*args, **kwargs)
          return inner

* Return a 404 response instead of throwing exceptions when an object is not
  found in the database.

  .. code-block:: python

      def get_object_or_404(model, **kwargs):
          try:
              return model.get(**kwargs)
          except model.DoesNotExist:
              abort(404)
