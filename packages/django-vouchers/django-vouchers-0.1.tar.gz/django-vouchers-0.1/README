This is a simple app to add vouchers support to your Django Project.

The idea is to define Forms for any kind of voucher that you want and add them to settings.VOUCHERS variable.

e.g:
VOUCHERS = [('tshirt', 'project.vouchers.VoucherTShirtForm')]

and then define in project/vouchers.py something like:



TSHIRT_SIZE = (('s', 'S'), ('m', 'M'), ('l', 'L'), ('xl', 'XL'), ('2xl', 'XXL'))

class VoucherTShirtForm(forms.Form):
    token = forms.Charfield(max_length=50)
    size = forms.ChoiceField(choices=TSHIRT_SIZE)
    address = forms.CharField(max_length=200)
    email = forms.EmailField()
