Installation
============

Install the stable version::

    $ pip install impress

Install the latest::

    $ pip install http://github.com/gawel/impress/tarball/master

Quick start
===========

.. slide::
   :class: dense

Write a ``index.rst`` file like this:

.. literalinclude:: sample.rst
   :language: rst

Then run::

    $ impress

Open ``html/index.html`` in your browser. That's all.

Read the `source <_sources/index.txt>`_ of this page to see more examples.

Inserting python code
=====================

With Sphinx's autodoc plugin:

.. autoclass:: impress.directives.Slide

Or by inserting some code:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    var foo = function() {
        alert('bar');
    }

You can insert Images
=====================

It's recommended to add images in a ``static`` folder but urls works too.

.. image:: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Python.svg
   :width: 300
   :height: 300
   :align: center

Hidden title
=============

.. step::
   :hide-title: true
   :class: black center
   :data-scale: 3

You may also want to hide title (required to create a step). And have fun with
css3 and others ``impress.js`` attributes.

But before that you may want to read a few technicals notes

Impress directive
==================

This directive allow to set some "global" options used for all slide found
after it.

.. literalinclude:: impress.txt
   :language: rst

Step / Slide directive
=======================

Per slide configuration. One of the step/slide directive **must** be added
after a section title to create a slide.

.. literalinclude:: step.txt
   :language: rst

The slide directive use the same arguments. It just add a css class ``slide``
automaticaly.

Positioning
===========

Positioning can be done manualy with the ``data-*`` attributes but you can use
the ``func`` attribute to auto positioning slides on the canvas.

Avalaible functions are stored in :mod:`impress.funcs`:

.. autofunction:: impress.funcs.default
.. autofunction:: impress.funcs.linear
.. autofunction:: impress.funcs.square
.. autofunction:: impress.funcs.spiral


Use your own algorithm
======================

This tools came with a set of function designed to position slides in the
canvas but you can use your own.

You just need to create a function like this:

.. literalinclude:: mymodule.py
   :pyobject: awesome_positioning

And use it in the ``func`` attribute of the ``impress``, ``step`` or ``slide``
directives.

See also the function used for those slides:

.. autofunction:: mymodule.documentation

Overriding the defaults
===============================

.. slide::
   :class: transparent

There is two way:

* If you add a ``custom.css`` and a ``custom.js`` in a ``static`` folder then
  impress will take care of it.

* If you need more advanced customization then you need to override the default
  template which is very simple and can be override to fit your needs.  Just copy
  it in a ``templates`` folder.
