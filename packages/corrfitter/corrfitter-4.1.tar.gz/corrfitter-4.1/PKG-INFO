Description:     This module contains tools that facilitate least-squares fits, as functions
            of time ``t``, of simulation (or other statistical) data for 2-point and
            3-point correlators of the form::
        
                Gab(t)    =  <b(t) a(0)>
                Gavb(t,T) =  <b(T) V(t) a(0)>
        
            Each correlator is modeled using |Corr2| for 2-point correlators, or
            |Corr3| for 3-point correlators in terms of amplitudes for each source
            ``a``, sink ``b``, and vertex ``V``, and the energies associated with each
            intermediate state. The amplitudes and energies are adjusted in the
            least-squares fit to reproduce the data; they are specified in a shared prior
            (typically a dictionary).
        
            An object of type |CorrFitter| describes a collection of correlators and is
            used to fit multiple models to data simultaneously. Any number of
            correlators may be described and fit by a single |CorrFitter| object.
            |CorrFitter| objects can also be used to to extract the appropriate fit
            data from |Dataset| objects.
            
            This module has been used extensively for analyzing results from lattice
            QCD simulations.
