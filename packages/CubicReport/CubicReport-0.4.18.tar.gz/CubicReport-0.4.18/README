Overview
========

CubicReport is a report engine based on Geraldo Reports.

Geraldo is a reports generator created to work like ReportBuilder, QuickReport
or Jasper Reports. It has bands with fixed width and flexible height to show on
top, summary, page header, page footer, in table or each one for an object.

It is under GPL and works only with Django framework and Python language.
