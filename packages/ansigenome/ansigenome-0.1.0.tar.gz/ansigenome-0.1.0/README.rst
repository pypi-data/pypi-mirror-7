Ansigenome
==========

Ansigenome is a command line tool designed to help you manage your Ansible roles. It does 6 things:

-  **scan** a path containing Ansible roles and report back useful stats
-  **rebuild** a path of roles which auto generates a ``README.md`` and ``meta/main.yml`` from templates
-  **run** shell commands inside of each role's directory
-  **init** new roles with a `travis-ci <https://travis-ci.org>`_ test already made for you
-  **export** a path of roles to a file to be consumed by ``ansible-galaxy install -r``
-  **dump** a json file containing every stat it gathers from a directory

Installation
============

If you have Ansible installed then you already have all of the dependencies you need to run Ansigenome. You have 2 options for installation:

``pip install ansigenome`` or ``easy_install ansigenome``

Ansible installed setup tools so you should already have ``easy_install``. You may need to use sudo if you get permission errors.

Usage
=====

The help is setup similar to Ansible's command line tools. Your best bet is to just type ``ansigenome`` in a terminal to get a list of commands and explore the options.

Stats gathered
==============

Here are the stats gathered which could be dumped to json if you wish.

::

    report = {
        "totals": {
            "roles": 0,
            "dependencies" 0,
            "defaults": 0,
            "facts": 0,
            "files": 0,
            "lines": 0,
        },
        "roles": {
            # All of the stats below get harvested from each role you scan.
            %role_name: {
                "total_dependencies": 0
                "total_defaults": 0,
                "total_facts": 0,
                "total_lines": 0,
                "total_files": 0,
                "facts": [],
                "dependencies": {},
                "defaults": [],
                "meta": {},
                "readme": "",
            }
        },
        "stats": {
            "longest_role_name_length": 0
        }
    }

Templates
=========

You might decide that the default templates don't suite your style. That's completely reasonable. You can supply your own readme and meta templates.

You can either provide a url to the template on the command line or a path to the template when you run the ``rebuild`` command.

README.md.j2
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are all of the values you have access to in the template if you decide to make your own custom readme template. Check `templates/README.md.j2 <https://github.com/nickjj/ansigenome/tree/master/templates/README.md.j2>`_ for an example.

::


    # The username supplied by the -u flag in Ansigenome.
    github_username: "%github_username"

    # The repo name supplied by Ansigenome.
    repo_name: "%repo_name"

    # The full role name in the galaxy format supplied by Ansigenome.
    galaxy_name: "%galaxy_name"

    # ============================================================================
    # You also have access to everything in the meta/main.yml.j2 template.
    # Look below in the meta/main.yml.j2 section to see a list of values.
    # ============================================================================

meta/main.yml.j2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are all of the values you have access to in the template if you decide to make your own custom meta template. Check `templates/meta/main.yml.j2 <https://github.com/nickjj/ansigenome/tree/master/templates/meta/main.yml.j2>`_ for an example.

::

Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute then check out `Ansible's contribution guide <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code-features-or-bugfixes>`_ because this project expects the same requirements and it contains great tips on using git branches.

In addition to that your code must pass the default pep8 style guide. I have travis running a test to ensure the code follows that guide but your best bet is to find a plugin for your editor if you don't have one already.

Author
======

Ansigenome was created by Nick Janetakis nick.janetakis@gmail.com.

Special thanks to `@drybjed <https://github.com/drybjed>`_ for coming up with the name of the tool. This project idea spawned from trying to break up his `ginas project <https://github.com/ginas/ginas>`_ into multiple roles. Neither of us wanted to manually make 50 repos and 50 readmes so I decided to learn Python and make this tool instead.
