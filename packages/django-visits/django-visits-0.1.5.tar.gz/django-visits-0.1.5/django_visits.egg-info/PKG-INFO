Description: Welcome
        *******
        
        Django visits is to be used as a hit-counter application for Django-powered web apps.
        
        You have two ways of how to use this app; first is to count requested urls (CounterMiddleware), the second is to count object visits (aka models)
        
        Configuration
        *************
        
        You settings file should contain the following settings 
        
        * MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_VISITS: the minimum allowed time between visits for the user to update counter
        * IGNORE_URLS: urls to ignore e.g. static urls etc.
        * IGNORE_USER_AGENTS: this is used to define what user agents to ignore
        * BOTS_USER_AGENTS: this is used to define whether user is real or bot is user by BotVisitorMiddleware
        * REQUEST_FIELDS_FOR_HASH: used to generate unique identifier for visitor
        * URI_WITH_GET_PARAMS: use get params to identify diferents uris
        * VISITS_OBJECTS_AS_COUNTERS: enable or disable the behavior of visits objects as counters (on False, every diferent visits is counted in a diferent object)
        
        BOTS_USER_AGENTS by default will have the following values
        
        ::
        
            [
                "Teoma", "alexa", "froogle", "Gigabot", "inktomi", "looksmart", "URL_Spider_SQL", "Firefly",
                "NationalDirectory", "Ask Jeeves", "TECNOSEEK", "InfoSeek", "WebFindBot", "girafabot", "crawler",
                "www.galaxy.com", "Googlebot", "Googlebot/2.1", "Google", "Webmaster", "Scooter", "James Bond",
                "Slurp", "msnbot", "appie", "FAST", "WebBug", "Spade", "ZyBorg", "rabaz", "Baiduspider",
                "Feedfetcher-Google", "TechnoratiSnoop", "Rankivabot", "Mediapartners-Google", "Sogou web spider",
                "WebAlta Crawler", "MJ12bot", "Yandex/", "YaDirectBot", "StackRambler", "DotBot", "dotbot"
            ]
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        * Add visits to INSTALLED_APPS
        
        ::
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = (
        	    # ...
        	    "visits",
        	)
        
        * If you want to filter some type of user agents you can define IGNORE_USER_AGENTS in your settings.py
        
        ::
        
            IGNORE_USER_AGENTS = ["Wget/", "curl/"]
        
        
        * If you want to filter bots from real users then in MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES set 
        
        ::
        
        	MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        	    # ...
        	    "visits.middleware.BotVisitorMiddleware",
        	)
        
        * If you want to count visits automatically per url the you should add CounterMiddleware to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
        
        ::
        
        	MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        	    # ...
        	    "visits.middleware.CounterMiddleware",
        	)
        
        * If you want to count visits automatically per url with get params you should add URI_WITH_GET_PARAMS=True to your settings.py
        
        * If you want count url visit manually you can do it the way below
        
        ::
        
        	from visits.models import Visits
        
        	def some_object_view(request, pk):
        	    Visit.objects.add_uri_visit(request, request.META["PATH_INFO"], APP_LABEL)
        	    #...
        	    #...
        
        * If you want count visits per object then it's similar to the example above
        
        ::
        
        	from visits.models import Visits
        
        	def some_object_view(request, pk):
        	    some_obj = get_object_or_404(SOME_MODEL, pk=pk)
        	    Visit.objects.add_object_visit(request, obj=some_obj)
        	    #...
        	    #...
        
        * From inside of a template you can get
        
         * object visits using get_visits
        
         * url visits using get_visits templatetag
        
        ::
        
        	{% load visits_tags %}
        
        	{% get_visits some_model_instance as visits %}
        	{% get_visits some_request_instance as visits %}
        	{% get_visits some_uri_regex as visits %}
        
        Note: to get uri visits using get_visits templatetag you should add the following to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
        
        ::
        
            TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
                #...
                "visits.context_processors.request_meta",
            )
        
        Have fun!
