Description: ===========
        Pysickle
        ===========
        
        **pysickle.py** will try to remove sequences that cause misalignments from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). It reads a given MSA in multi-fasta format and removes sequences with the highest penalty scores, then builds the next MSA without those sequences. This process is repeated until a user-specified cuttoff is reached or less than three sequences are left to be aligned.
        
        Usage::
        
            ######################################
            # pysickle.py
            ######################################
            usage:
                pysickle.py -f multifasta alignment
            options:
                -f, --fasta=FILE    multifasta alignment (eg "align.fas")
                OR
                -F, --fasta_dir=DIR directory with multifasta files (needs -s SUFFIX)
                -s, --suffix=SUFFIX will try to work with files that end with SUFFIX
                                    (eg ".fas")
        
                -a, --msa_tool=STR  supported: "mafft" [default:"mafft"]
                -i, --max_iterations=NUM    force stop after NUM iterations
                -n, --num_threads=NUM   max number of threads to be executed in 
                                        parallel [default: 1]
        
                -h, --help      prints this
