        Introduction
        ============
        
        A small set of generic content interfaces, adapters and base classes associated to ZTFY
        packages.
        
        Most of these have been extracted from ZTFY.blog to reduce dependencies with
        this package from other application packages not really using ZTFY.blog content
        management features.
