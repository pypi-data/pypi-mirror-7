Examples
========
If you downloaded a source archive or cloned pyQode from github, you will find a
series of examples in the examples directory at the root of the archive.

All examples requires pyqode.core to be installed.

.. note:: All examples are bindings independent so that all user can run them
          without being required to install an unwanted qt binding.

Gui integration
-----------------

This simple example show how you can build a simple generic editor using
pyqode.core. The example user interface has been designed in Qt Designer using
the pyqode.core plugins to add the QGenericCodeEdit to the ui.

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/gui_integration/simple_editor.py
   :linenos:

.. note:: This example makes use of a designer ui file compiled using the
          translate_ui script. This script call the pyside compiler and replace
          a few imports to make it usable by both bindings. You typically don't
          need to do that in a real world application where you use one qt
          binding.

Force PyQt4
----------------

This example shows you how you can force pyQode to use PyQt4.

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/qt_bindings/pyqt4.py
   :linenos:
