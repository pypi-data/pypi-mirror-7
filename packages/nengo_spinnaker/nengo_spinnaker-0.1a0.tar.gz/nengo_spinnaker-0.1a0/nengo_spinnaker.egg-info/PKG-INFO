Description: Nengo is a suite of software used to build and simulate
        large-scale brain models using the methods of the Neural Engineering Framework.
        SpiNNaker is a neuromorphic hardware platform designed to run large-scale
        spiking neural models in real-time. Using SpiNNaker to simulate Nengo models
        allows you to run models in real-time and interface with external hardware
        devices such as robots.
