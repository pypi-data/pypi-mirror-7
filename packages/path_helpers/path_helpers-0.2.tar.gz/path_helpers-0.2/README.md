`path_helpers`
==============

Provides helper class for working with file paths.

The `path_helpers.path` class provides an object-oriented approach to file-path
operations, as opposed to using the procedural [`os.path` API][1].

This package is forked from Jason Orendorff's [`path.py` 2.2 package][2].

__Note__ There are several other forks of [`path.py`][2] that have likely added
more functionality.
