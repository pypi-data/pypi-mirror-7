        Monitoring UI
        
        This monitoring UI is implemented as a horizon plugin that adds a panel.
        You need to copy the file from enabled directory into horizon's openstack_dashboard/local/enabled directory.
        You need to symlink the monitoring directory into horizon top level directory.
