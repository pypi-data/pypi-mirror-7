A python interface to the the C++ SeqAn sequence analysis library
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures
for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data. SeqAn
applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, 
extensibility, and integration with other libraries. SeqAn is easy to use and
simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance.
