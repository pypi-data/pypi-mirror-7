Indexes
=======

.. testsetup:: *

   import seqan

An index is the result of pre-processing a text to allow fast look-up
and search operations. The enhanced suffix array (ESA) is an index that allows
retrieval of substrings based on their content. We can build an ESA from a string
set easily.

..  doctest::

    >>> seqs = seqan.StringDNASet(('ACGT', 'AAAA', 'GGGG', 'AC'))
    >>> index = seqan.IndexStringDNASetESA(seqs)


Iterators
---------

Once we have the index we can find substrings in the string set using a top down iterator.

..  doctest::

    >>> iterator = index.topdown()
    >>> if iterator.goDown('AC'):
    ...     print '"{0}" starts a suffix in our index'.format(iterator.representative)
    ...     for occ in iterator.occurrences:
    ...         print 'Found "{0}" in sequence {1} at position {2}'.format(iterator.representative, occ.i1, occ.i2)
    "AC" starts a suffix in our index
    Found "AC" in sequence 3 at position 0
    Found "AC" in sequence 0 at position 0

An iterator points to a particular location in an index. In the case of an ESA,
it identifies all the suffixes that start with a given representative substring.
Here we used the *occurrences* property of the top down iterator to locate all the
occurrences of the substring AC in the original string set. We also used the
*representative* property to access the substring the iterator refers to. The *replength*
property is an efficient way to access the length of the representative substring.

..  doctest::

    >>> print '"{0}" has length {1}'.format(iterator.representative, iterator.repLength)
    "AC" has length 2

The *numOccurrences* property holds the number of occurrences of the substring in the
entire string set.

..  doctest::

    >>> print '"{0}" has {1} occurrences'.format(iterator.representative, iterator.numOccurrences)
    "AC" has 2 occurrences


The *numChildren* property holds the number of occurrences in the children of this iterator, that
is it shows how many of the representative substring for this node do not terminate here.

..  doctest::

    >>> print '"{0}" has {1} occurrence in child nodes'.format(iterator.representative, iterator.numChildren)
    "AC" has 1 occurrence in child nodes

TopDown iterators can go down and right to traverse the entire index from the root node.
SeqAn also provides an iterator that can go up. This iterator is slightly less efficient so
should only be used if required.

..  doctest::

    >>> historyiterator = index.topdownhistory()
    >>> if historyiterator.goDown('AC'):
    ...     print '"{0}" starts a suffix in our index'.format(historyiterator.representative)
    ...     if historyiterator.goUp():
    ...         print '"{0}" starts a suffix in our index'.format(historyiterator.representative)
    "AC" starts a suffix in our index
    "A" starts a suffix in our index


Vertexes
--------

At a lower level in the SeqAn library each iterator refers to a vertex in the ESA. The values
of these vertexes can be accessed through the *value* property.

..  doctest::

    >>> print 'The ID of the vertex for "{0}" is {1}'.format(iterator.representative, iterator.value.id)
    The ID of the vertex for "AC" is 8

These values can be used to refer to vertexes in a stable way, providing the underlying ESA does
not change.

..  doctest::

    >>> it = index.topdown()
    >>> it.goDown('AC')
    True
    >>> print it.representative
    AC
    >>> vertex = it.value  # Save vertex for "AC"
    >>> it.goDown('GT')
    True
    >>> print it.representative
    ACGT
    >>> it.value = vertex  # Reset to vertex for "AC"
    >>> print it.representative
    AC
