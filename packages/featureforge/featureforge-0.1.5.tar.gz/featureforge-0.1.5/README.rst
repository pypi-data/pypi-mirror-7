Feature Forge
=============

This library provides a set of tools that can be useful in many machine
learning applications (classification, clustering, regression, etc.), and
particularly helpful if you use scikit-learn (although this can work if
you have a different algorithm).

Most machine learning problems involve an step of feature definition and
preprocessing. Feature Forge helps you with:

 * Defining and documenting features
 * Testing your features against specified cases and against randomly generated
   cases (stress-testing). This helps you making your application more robust
   against invalid/misformatted input data. This also helps you checking that
   low-relevance results when doing feature analysis is actually because the
   feature is bad, and not because there's a slight bug in your feature code.
 * Evaluating your features on a data set, producing a feature evaluation
   matrix. The evaluator has a robust mode that allows you some tolerance both
   for invalid data and buggy features.
 * Experimentation: running, registering, classifying and reproducing
   experiments for determining best settings for your problems.
