class Vectorizer(object):
    """
    Vectorizer(features) provides a scikit-learn compatible component that
    given a collection of data points turns it into a matrix of vectors,
    where each vector contains the evaluation of every given feature for a
    single data point.

    Numerical features are mapped to a column of the resulting matrix.
    Enumerated features are mapped to multiple columns (one for each possible
    enumerated value), using 0 or 1 to indicate the presence of the enumerated
    value. Vectorial features are mapped to multiple columns.

    The API of this class follows scikit-learn conventions, see
    http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html


    Vectorizer(features, tolerant=True) changes the feature evaluation strategy
    to one that is more tolerant to failures when evaluating features. It is
    useful for testing and to run rough experiments when you still aren't sure
    if your data is clean or your features are correct. See the documentation
    for featureforge.evaluator.TolerantFeatureEvaluator

    Vectorizer(features, sparse=True) changes the result data type, returning a
    sparse numpy matrix instead of a dense matrix. See the documentation on
    featureforge.flattener.Flattener

            - If the feature spawns numbers then `value` is `None` and should
              be ignored.
            - If the feature spawns strings then `value` is the string that
              corresponds to the one-hot encoding of that column.

              the spawned array that corresponds to that column.
