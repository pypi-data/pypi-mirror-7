Description: 
        This module allows for order agnostic comparisonâ€Ž of XML data. It will 
        parse files to determine if they are a match while ignoring the order 
        of attributes or elements .
        
        Dependencies: ElementTree
        
        Sample usage:
        
        #open two files, parse with ElementTree, and pass to xml_diff function
        
        oFile1 = open(r'C:\test1.xml', 'r')
        
        oFile2 = open(r'C:\test2.xml', 'r')
        
        oXml1 = ET.parse(oFile1)
        
        oXml2 = ET.parse(oFile2)
        
        print xml_diff(oXml1, oXml2)
        
        #pass in xml as strings
        
        sOrder1 = '<ItalianFood><Pizza Sauce="Red" Cheese="Mozzarella" Crust="Thin"><Quantity>2</Quantity></Pizza><Pizza Sauce="OliveOil" Cheese="Feta" Crust="Thin"><Quantity>1</Quantity></Pizza></ItalianFood>'
        
        sOrder2 = '<ItalianFood><Pizza Sauce="OliveOil" Cheese="Feta" Crust="Thin"><Quantity>1</Quantity></Pizza><Pizza Sauce="Red" Cheese="Mozzarella" Crust="Thin"><Quantity>2</Quantity></Pizza></ItalianFood>'
        
        print xml_diff(sOrder1, sOrder2)
