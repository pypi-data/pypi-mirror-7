captainhook
===========

Git hook scripts

What is it
----------

A set of configurable git hooks and checks.

Upon committing code, the pre-commit hook runs configured checks against the
files to be committed and rejects the commit if any of the checks turned on fail.

Installation
------------

Install using pip::

    pip install captainhook

You can then install the hooks using::

    captainhook install

from within any git repo, and the pre-commit hook will be installed.

Running without commiting
-------------------------

You can perform a run against all your code base using::

    captainhook run


Setting Up
----------

To turn a check on or off, create a ``tox.ini`` file
in the base directory of your project with a ``captainhook`` section.

eg::


    [captainhook]
    flake8=off
    pdb=off
    python3=on
    block_branch=on;master


flake8, pdb and python3 checks default to being on.

Checks can also be passed arguments from the config file. This is done with
the following notation::

    <check_name>=<status>;<string to be passed through>

Currently checks can only be passed a single argument and must do the parsing
of that themselves.

flake8 obeys the configuration as per the
`flake8 docs <http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html>`_ but any
path-related options will need to use wildcard patterns (e.g.
`exclude=*/migrations/*` instead of `exclude=migrations`).

To avoid being checked at all, you can commit using the ``--no-verify`` flag::

    git commit -a --no-verify



Checks
------

Currently supported checks are

- pdb: Checks to see if there are any uncommented
  ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`` statements in the code to be committed.

- flake8: Runs flake8 against the files that are set to be committed.

- python3: Checks to see if python files set to be committed are python3
  compatible.

- isort: Checks to see if all import statements have been sorted correctly.

- grep: Runs the given grep command against the files in your commit.

  * Takes a single argument; options which will be passed through to grep
    verbatim.

  * Currently you can only specify a single grep command.

- block_branch: Checks if the current branch is in a list of branches that
  should not be committed to.

- merge_marks: Checks if there are any signs of unresolved merge marks in the
  files to be committed.

Output
------

You only see output for checks that fail, otherwise silence.

Extending
---------

You can add your own check to your git env quite easily.

Simply add a module to ``.git/hooks/checkers`` with a ``run()`` method defined.

The method should return the error string on faillure, or a False like object
on success.

For example::

    $ cat .git/hooks/checkers/mine.py
    DEFAULT = 'on'
    def run():
        return "NOT A CHANCE"

This will block all commits if enabled.

A checker can set the following variables:

DEFAULT: used to determine the check is assumed "on" or "off". This value is
only used if tox.ini has not been used to override it. The default DEFAULT is
off.

CHECK_NAME: To override the display name of the module.

REQUIRED_FILES: Files that, if present, should be included in the copy to the
temp directoy before analysis takes place.

Feedback
--------

I'm interested in hearing feedback - positive or negative - about this.

Please make yourself at home, create issues if you've got problems with existing behaviour, or suggestions for future improvements or anything else.

Developing
----------

Running pre-commit.py on its own will by default create copies of the files to
be committed which you probably don't want when testing a new check.

You can run the script against all your code base using::

    python captainhook/pre_commit.py --all
