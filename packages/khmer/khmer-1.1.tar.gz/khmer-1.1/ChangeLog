    * scripts/normalize-by-median.py: Fixed unbound variable bug introduced in
    20a433c2.

2014-03-31  Michael R. Crusoe  <mcrusoe@msu.edu>

    * docs/scripts.txt,scripts/*.py,khmer/*.py: overhaul the documentation of
    the scripts. Uses sphinxcontrib.autoprogram to leverage the existing
    argparse objects. Moved the documentation into each script + misc cleanups.
    All scripts support the --version option. Migrated the last scripts to use
    khmer_args

    that it matches the behavior of Distribution.get_command_obj(). This fixes
    issues with 'pip install -e' and './setup.py nosetests' not respecting the
    setup.cfg configuration directives for the build_ext command. Also
    enhanced our build_ext command to respect the dry_run mode.

    * .ycm_extra_conf.py: Update our custom YouCompleteMe configuration to
    query the package configuration for the proper compilation flags.
