            attribute of an individual feature.

            time-consuming for many features.

            Sorted, merged iterable

        new_featuretype : string or None
            The new features will all be of this type, or, if None (default)
            then the featuretypes will be constructed from the neighboring
            features, e.g., `inter_exon_exon`.

        attribute_func : callable or None
            If None, then nothing special is done to the attributes.  If
            callable, then the callable accepts two attribute dictionaries and
            returns a single attribute dictionary.  If `merge_attributes` is
            True, then `attribute_func` is called before `merge_attributes`.
            This could be useful for manually managing IDs for the new
            features.

        feature : str or Feature instance

            control the display of CDS as thicker blocks and UTRs as thinner
            blocks.

            Note that the features for `thick` or `thin` are *not*

        thick_featuretype : str or list
            Child featuretype(s) to use in order to determine the boundaries of
            the "thick" blocks. In BED12 format, these represent coding
            sequences; typically this would be set to "CDS".  This argument is
            mutually exclusive with `thin_featuretype`.

            Specifically, the BED12 thickStart will be the start coord of the
            first `thick` item and the thickEnd will be the stop coord of the
            last `thick` item.

        thin_featuretype : str or list
            Child featuretype(s) to use in order to determine the boundaries of
            the "thin" blocks.  In BED12 format, these represent untranslated
            regions.  Typically "utr" or ['three_prime_UTR', 'five_prime_UTR'].
            Mutually exclusive with `thick_featuretype`.

            Specifically, the BED12 thickStart field will be the stop coord of
            the first `thin` item and the thickEnd field will be the start
            coord of the last `thin` item.

        name_field : str
            Which attribute of `feature` to use as the feature's name.  If this

        color : None or str
