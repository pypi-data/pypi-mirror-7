Description: # Pyramid Angular Starter
        
        This is a project scaffold for the [pyramid web
        framework](http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about) that
        is setup for javascript development using
        [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) and other nice things.
        
        Hopefully it will save you an hour or 2 when you are starting that
        next awesome twitter clone.
        
        
        
        ## Project generation
        
        This is a project scaffold so you use it in the normal pyramid way.
        
        
        ```bash
        
        $ pcreate -l
        
        Available scaffolds:
          alchemy:                 Pyramid SQLAlchemy project using url dispatch
          angularjs:               Pyramid + Angularjs
          angularjs_w_user:        Pyramid + Angularjs + User model, registration, forgot password
          pyramid_jinja2_starter:  pyramid jinja2 starter project
          starter:                 Pyramid starter project
          zodb:                    Pyramid ZODB project using traversal
        ```
        
        Note the additional scaffold "angularjs" and "angularjs_w_user", running pcreate with either of these
        scaffolds will generate a project skeleton with the following
        "features".
        
        * pyramid project setup with jinja2, sqlalchemy, and a request local session attribute "db"
        * a javascript project under <project_name>/client-src setup with bower, gulp, coffeescript and sass
        * a skeleton angularjs project + foundation css
        
        additionally, angular_js_w_user provides a user model and views for the following.
        
        * login
        * logout
        * registration
        * forgot password
        
        database migrations via alembic are already configured with this template as well.
        
        Hopefully everything else is self explanatory. :)
