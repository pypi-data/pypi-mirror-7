Astropysics: astrophysics utilities for python
==============================================
:Author: `Erik Tollerud <http://www.physics.uci.edu/~etolleru/>`_

Astropysics is a library containing a variety of utilities and algorithms for
reducing, analyzing, and visualizing astronomical data. Best of all, it
encourages the user to leverage the existing capabilities of Python to make this
quick, easy, and as painless as cutting-edge science can even actually be. There
do exist other Python packages with some of the capabilities of this project,
but the goal of this project is to integrate all these tools together and make
them interact in the most straightforward ways possible.

.. note ::
    The functionality of Astropysics is currently being incorporated
    into `the Astropy project <http://www.astropy.org>`_.  Astropy is a
    wider community effort, and to avoid wasting resources, most of the
    energy that initially went into developing Astropysics have been
    shifted to Astropy.  As a result, Astropysics is no longer getting
    new features - those efforts are now in Astropy. Within the next few
    versions of Astropy, we expect it will include all the functionality
    of Astropysics (and more).

    Astropysics will continue to be supported in the form of bug fixes,
    though, and will be available for use roughly in its current form
    for the foreseeable future.  So any existing code can continue to
    use Astropysics, but for new work, I suggest you begin transitioning
    to Astropy if it supports your needs.

Contents
========

Astropysics is divided into two major subcomponents - the core modules that
contain functions and classes to the calculations and organize data, and the gui
module that contains a number of useful small-scale astronomy applications.

Quick Install
=============

See :doc:`install` for full install instructions, including prerequisite
packages.

To install a current release of astropysics, the simplest approach is::

    pip install astropysics

(on unix-like systems or OS X, add "sudo " before this command)

If you want the must up-to-date (possible unstable) version, do::

    hg clone https://astropysics.googlecode.com/hg/ astropysics-dev
    cd astropysics-dev
    python setup.py develop

(note that `mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ must be installed, and
on some systems the last command may need to have "sudo " at the beginning)

You can also alter the source code if you use this approach (see :doc:`develop`
for guidelines of working contributing source code).

In either case, afterwords you can run::

    astpys-setup

to install optional packages and setup the environment.


Bug Reports
===========

The best place to report bugs is via the `google code bug tracker <http://code.google.com/p/astropysics/issues>`_.  That way they won't be forgotten unless an asteroid impact destroys all of google's servers.
