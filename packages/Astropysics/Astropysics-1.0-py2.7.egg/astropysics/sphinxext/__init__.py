sphinext -- extentensions for sphinx documentation builder
==========================================================

This module contains various extensions for the `sphinx
`<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/> documentation building tool. These extensions are
used to build the astropysics sphinx documentation, although they can be used
elsewhere simply by including ``astropysics.sphinxext.<modname>`` in the
extensions list in a project's ``conf.py``.
