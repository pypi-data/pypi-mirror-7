        MCMO stands for 'Management Command Multiple Override'
        Allows multiple apps to override the same management command in Django
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Install using your prefered method
        2. replace the line::
        
            from django.core import management
        
        by::
        
            from django_mcmo import management
        
        in your manage.py file
        
        3. You can now use applications that concurrently define overrides for
           django.core management commands. Both commands will be called.
        
        
        Alternative usage
        -----------------
        
        If your manage.py is automatically generated (e.g. if you are using buildout
        and djangorecipe), simply make sure that the statement::
        
            import django_mcmo
        
        is executed before calling django.management.execute_from_command_line.
        
        Importing the package patches the django.core.management module, which
        functions are then multiple-override enabled.
        
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        The same-name overrides must derive from the same Command class, or at least
        from the same Command base class (AppCommand, LabelCommand or NoArgsCommand).
        
        In practice, same-name command will only be met when two apps override a
        core django management command. They will therefore derive from the same
        Command class, and cause no issue (except if the same options are defined in
        the two commands).
