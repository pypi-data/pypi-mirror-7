PyAutoGUI is planned as a replacement for other Python GUI automation scripts, such as PyUserInput, PyKeyboard, PyMouse, pykey, etc. Eventually it would be great to offer the same type of features that [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org) offers.

For now, the primary aim for PyAutoGUI is cross-platform mouse and keyboard control and a simple API.

Future features planned (specific versions not planned yet):

- Find a list of all windows and their captions.
- Click coordinates relative to a window, instead of the entire screen.
- Make it easier to work on systems with multiple monitors.
- Basic image recognition, using the Pillow/PIL modules.
- GetKeyState() type of function
- Ability to set global hotkey on all platforms so that there can be an easy "kill switch" for GUI automation programs.
- Optional nonblocking pyautogui calls.
