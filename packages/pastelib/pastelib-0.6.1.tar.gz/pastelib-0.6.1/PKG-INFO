Description: pastelib v0.6.1
        ========
        
        A Python library for interfacing with various pastebins; forked from the now-defunct lodgeitlib with permission.
        
        At the moment, I am just making available the source code of the old lodgeitlib. I intend to work on it
        in the near future, however, and put it back on PyPI.
        
        Lodgeitlib is documented here: https://pythonhosted.org/lodgeitlib/index.html
        
        According to the author, he removed the package from PyPI because the pocoo.org pastebin (the main implementation
        of lodgeit at the time) became defunct. However, there are several pastebins still around that use spacepaste,
        a successor to lodgeitlib (including bpaste.net), and I am using the software in a personal project, so I'm forking
        it and making it publicly available once again.
        
        The source is still under the MIT license, as the original was.
