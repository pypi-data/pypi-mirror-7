Description: Drat
        ====
        
        Text analysis tool written in Python 3.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Drat is a tool that analyzes reading texts and produces a brief report
        which gives a readability score and the number of uncommon words
        (according to the General Service List) in the text. It also lists all
        of these uncommon words (if you choose the verbose option).
        
        Drat supports **docx**, **odt**, **ods**, **odp** files as well as text
        files and urls.
        
        You can also analyze multiple texts / links by creating a text file
        with the filenames / links written in it.
        
        Use
        ~~~
        
        drat [-h] [-v] [-w wordlist-file] file-or-url
        
        -  multiple files, or urls, can be analyzed
        -  the files can be text files, docx files, or odf files
        -  a list of urls, or files, written in a text file can be redirected to drat:
           e.g., drat < list-of-urls.txt
        -  -w use an additional wordlist(s)
        -  This wordlist needs to be a text file with each word on a separate line
        -  More than one wordlist can be used
        
        For example, the following command will analyze an office (Writer)
        document called 'NorwegianBlue.odt':
        
        ::
        
            drat NorwegianBlue.odt
        
        The -w option will let you filter out additional words:
        
        ::
        
            drat -w euphemisms_death.txt NorwegianBlue.odt 
        
        And this command will download the following url and analyze the text in
        it:
        
        ::
        
            drat http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode24.htm
        
        It is also possible to analyze several files in one command:
        
        ::
        
            drat CastleAaaarrrggh.txt LuvinmyTummy.docx PininFjords.odt
        
        The following command uses a text file with links in it (one link per
        line) and parses the links in it:
        
        ::
        
            drat < list-of-urls.txt
        
        Adding the -v option to any of the above commands will give you a list
        of the uncommon words.
