Description: plotutils
        =========
        
        This is where I keep matplotlib-related plotting utility functions I have found useful.
        
        setfig
        ------
        This will create a new figure (same as plt.figure() call in matplotlib):
        ```python
        from plotutils.plotutils import setfig
        setfig(None)
        ```
        You can also set the current figure to be a given figure number, clear it, and start over, e.g.: `setfig(3)`.
        
        `setfig(0)` will do nothing, implying you want to overplot on the currently active figure.
        
        I use the `setfig` function in every function that I write that makes a plot, almost always as follows:
        
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        def my_plot(x,y,fig=None,**kwargs):
          setfig(fig)
          plt.plot(x,y,**kwargs)
        ```
