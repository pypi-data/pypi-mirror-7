        dennis is a command line tool for translating and linting .po files.
        
        It includes the following subcommands:
        
        * **lint**: Lints ``.po`` files for problems including errors that
          can cause your production system to crash.
        
          The system allows for defining other variable formats.
        
        * **linttemplate**: Lints ``.pot`` files for problems in strings that
          lead to poor localizations.
        
        * **status**: Get a high-level status of a ``.po`` file including
          a list of unstranslated strings.
        
        * **translate**: Translates strings in ``.po`` files into something
          else! Comes with an HTML extractor (tokenizes strings so that only
          the text is translated) and a bunch of translations like
          Pirate!.
        
          This is helpful for l10n testing, development, finding unicode/layout
          problems, amazing your friends, hilarious April 1st shenanigans, etc.
        
          Specify the tokenizer/transform pipeline you want to use that combines
          things. Zombie? Sure! Shouty Zombie? Ok! Manic shouty Dubstep? Bring
          it on!
        
          This also works on strings passed in as command line arguments and
          as stdin---it doesn't have to be a ``.po`` file or in a ``.po``
          format. For example, Dennis uses dennis to translate all dennis
          commit messages into Pirate!. That's how cool dennis is!

        Translate a ``.po`` file with HTML in the strings in place into Pirate!::
        
            $ dennis-cmd translate --pipeline=html,pirate \
