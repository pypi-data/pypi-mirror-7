Per client/user/whatever django template and statics theming

WHY
===

When you need to use custom template and/or styling based on a model
in your app (Site, User, etc...).

pimpmytheme will create a folder per "client" (a client can be a
User, a Site or everything that implement the get_current method (see
below). It also can be used for multiple projects at the same
time. The folders are under a project name folder located in the
pimpmytheme directory. Your designer can then pull/push this
repository to edit the whole look and feel of all your projects in the
same repository!

How
===

with the help of custom template loader ans static file loader,
pimpmytheme load the custom template and statics files if they exists
for the current object.

INSTALLATION
============

    >>> pip install pimpmytheme

CONFIGURATION
=============

add pimpmytheme in your INSTALLED_APPS :

    INSTALLED_APPS = ('pimpmytheme',
                      ...
                      )

add the pimpmytheme staticfiles_finder to your STATICFILES_FINDERS :

    STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
        "pimpmytheme.static_finder.CustomFinder",
        "django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder",
        )

add the custom template loader to your TEMPLATE_LOADERS:

    TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
        'pimpmytheme.template_loader.Loader',
        'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader',
        )

finaly, you need a model with the "get_current" method. get_current
will return the object responsible for customization. For example, you
can use the django.contrib.sites.Site model to customize your project
per a site basis:

    CUSTOM_THEME_LOOKUP_OBJECT = "django.contrib.sites.models.Site"
    CUSTOM_THEME_LOOKUP_ATTR = "name"

To create the needed folders for customization, you can run the
management command provided by pimpmytheme:

    $ python manage.py create_folders

inside custom_form you will get a folder named as your project
name. Inside this folder you wil get as many folder as you
customization model objects. If you use the Site, you will get a
example.com folder.

Inside this folder you will find a static folder containing an empty
custom.less file. Here for your convenience. you can start editing
this file to customize your style.

You can also create a template folder next to the static one and put
some custom templates in it.

the pimpmytheme template loader will first look in this directory to
load templates files. If not found, it will fallback on the django
template loader
