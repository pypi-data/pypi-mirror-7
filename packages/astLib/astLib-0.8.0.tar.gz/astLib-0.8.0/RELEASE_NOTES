RELEASE NOTES:


New in version 0.8.x:
---------------------

* See the CHANGE_LOG

 
New in version 0.7.x:
---------------------

* See the CHANGE_LOG


New in version 0.6.x:
---------------------

New in version 0.5.0:
---------------------

* See the CHANGE_LOG


New in version 0.4.0:
---------------------

* Added fast code for fitting broadband Spectral Energy Distributions using stellar population models in 
  astSED. Can now apply the Calzetti et al. extinction law to SED objects.

* Major bug fixes:
    - astPlots.ImagePlot and conversion of numpy arrays of WCS <-> pixel coordinates now works on python 2.6
      (these were related).
    - tick labels around dec +/- 00 degrees in astPlots.ImagePlot now correct when in sexagesimal mode.

* For other miscellaneous changes and enhancements, see the CHANGE_LOG


New in version 0.3.2:
---------------------

* Major bug fixes: 
    - astWCS.WCS now handles HIERARCH keywords without crashing.
    - Occasional rounding errors on astPlot axis labels when in sexagesimal mode should now be gone.
    - fixes to NEDQueryPlot.py, MStarEvolution.py example scripts.

* For other miscellaneous changes and enhancements, see the CHANGE_LOG


New in version 0.3.1:
---------------------

* Faster contour overlay generation code enabled by default (an optional, slower "high accuracy" mode can
  alternatively be selected instead). Fixed a regression introduced in 0.3.0 that stopped contour generation
  working over images with headers without CDi_j matrices.

* Fixed bug when parsing FITS headers with extra long header cards (as can be found in e.g. headers of some
  Chandra images). Previously, these would cause the coordinate conversion routines to fail.

* Added some extra plot objects to ImagePlot (new plot symbols, a scale bar).

* Rewritten coordinate axes labelling in ImagePlot - should now be much more robust, and automatically
  choose sensible tick steps. If it doesn't, it can now be easily overridden.

* Added clipUsingRADecCoords, resampleToTanProjection to astImages module.


New in version 0.3.0:
---------------------

* The astSED module - a module for calculating colours, magnitudes from spectral energy distributions
  (SEDs). Currently, this supports the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and Maraston (2005) stellar population
  models. It is not very optimised at present.
  
* The new ImagePlot class - this replaces the old plotting routines in the astPlots module. ImagePlot has
  a simpler and more flexible interface, and supports RGB images, overplotting object symbols (with 
  coordinates specified in R.A., dec.), and contour overlays.

* Revised clipping routines in astImages - now return dictionaries with keys 'data', 'wcs' (instead
  of 'clippedData', clippedWCS'), and can now clip rectangular image sections.

* New example scripts.

* Several other new functions, bug fixes and enhancements - see documentation for details.
