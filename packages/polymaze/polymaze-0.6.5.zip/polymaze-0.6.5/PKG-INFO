Description: =================================================
        PolyMaze - Create mazes from a variety of sources
        =================================================
        
        This utility converts several different kinds of inputs into mazes.
        
        Allowed Inputs:
        
        - Aspect ratio (height / width) of a rectangular maze
        - String - convert the content of the string into a maze / mazes
        - Image - convert the dark parts of an image into a maze / mazes
        
        Options:
        
        - Complexity - adjust the difficulty
        - Font - use your own font when making a String maze (especially for unicode strings)
        - Shape - explicitly choose the type of tesselation used in the maze

        Installation:
        =============
        
        ``polymaze`` should work with Py2 or Py3.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install polymaze
        
        If you get the error ``decoder zip not available`` when using it, then probably
        ``PILLOW`` did not install completely. Try to upgrade or reinstall
        ``PILLOW`` and make sure it says png support was installed.
        
        Commandline Usage:
        ==================
        
        To make a generic rectangular maze, at the command line:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            polymaze
        
        To see all options:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            polymaze -h
        
        For example, to make a string into a maze with some extra options (note the \n
        gets converted to a real newline internally):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            polymaze --string "Happy\nBirthday!" --complexity 10 --shape Polycat
        
        Everything above assumes the command line entry point (named polymaze) works
        after installation. If not, then you will need to replace "polymaze ..." with
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            python /your_install_location/polymaze/cli.py ...
        
        
        Library Usage:
        ==============
        
        Please see demo/demo.py for examples of how to use the components.
        
        The primary components are PolyGrid (the geometric core of the whole package),
        and PolyMaze which converts a PolyGrid into a maze.
        
        Extension:
        ==========
        
        If anyone is interested, I can document how to specify new tessellations.
        
        Background and Feedback:
        ========================
        
        I developed this to regain some of my basic trigonometry skills which I have
        lost over the years.
        
        If you find this useful or have any feedback, please let me know! Specifically
        I have only tested this on Windows so please make an issue if it doesn't work
        in Linux, etc.
