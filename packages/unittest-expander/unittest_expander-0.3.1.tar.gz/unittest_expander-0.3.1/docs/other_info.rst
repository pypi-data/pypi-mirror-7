Up to now, I (Jan) am the only author of the library design and code -- although, of course, there were some inspirations; see the following section to learn about some of them.

Before creating this library I checked out several other projects and resources related to unit test parameterization in Python.  Some of them are mature and actively maintained projects, others are just minor drafts; some depend (contrary to this library) on external libraries or testing frameworks, others not; some are nice and user-friendly, others not so much (though that's a matter of taste, of course)...  Anyway, here are the links:
