Changes
=======

0.3.1 (2014-08-19)
------------------

* Several tests/documentation-related fixes and improvements.


0.3.0 (2014-08-17)
------------------

* Improved signatures of the **foreach()** decorator and the
  **paramseq** constructor: they take either exactly one positional
  argument which must be a test parameter collection (as previously: a
  sequence/mapping/set or a **paramseq** instance, or a callable
  returning an iterable...), or *any number of positional and/or keyword
  arguments* being test parameters (singular parameter values, tuples of
  parameter values or **param** instances...).  For example,
  ``@foreach([1, 42])`` can now also be spelled as ``@foreach(1, 42)``.

* Several tests/documentation-related updates, fixes and improvements.


0.2.1 (2014-08-12)
------------------

* Important setup/configuration fixes (repairing 0.2.0 regressions):

  * a setup-breaking bug in *setup.py* has been fixed;
  * a bug in the configuration of Sphinx (the tool used to generate
    the documentation) has been fixed.

* Some setup-related cleanups.
