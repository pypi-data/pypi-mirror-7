        Written by Benjamin Wallis
        
        ## Overview
        Hanotify is a commandline tool for monitoring crash reports that are submitting to HockeyApp. When hanotify detects that a crash report is at a vertain level of severity, it will send an email to given developer.
        
        ## Setup
        Hanotify is built using Python 2.7.5. The actual installation of the tools uses setuptools, so to install hanotify as a system wide command line tool, simply run the following command from the root:
        
        ```
            sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Please note that Notify does require that you have the hockeylib package installed on your system. You will need to clone and install this package manually. The link to the repo is below:
