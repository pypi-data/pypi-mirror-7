        Install requirements
        --------------------
        
        - Docsplit: http://documentcloud.github.com/docsplit/
        - GraphicsMagick
        - ghostscript (version 9.0 preferred)
        - Poppler
        - tesseract (optional)
        - pdftk (optional)
        - OpenOffice or LibreOffice (optional, for doc, excel, ppt, etc. types)
        - md5 or md5sum command line tool
        
        
        Async Integration
        -----------------
        
        It it highly recommended to install and configure plone.app.async
        in combination with this package. Doing so will manage all pdf
        conversions processes asynchronously so the user isn't delayed
        so much when saving files.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        The product can be configured via a control panel item
        `Document Viewer Settings`.
        
        Some interesting configuration options:
        
        Storage Type
            If you want to be able to serve you files via amazon cloud, 
            this will allow you to store the data in flat files that
            can be synced to another server.
        Storage Location
            Where are the server to store the files.
        OCR
            Use tesseract to scan the document for text. This process ca be
            slow so if your pdfs do not need to be OCR'd, you may disable.
        Auto Select Layout
            For pdf files added to the site, automatically select the
            document viewer display.
        Auto Convert
            When pdf files are added and modified, automatically convert.
        Auto layout file types
            Types that should automatically be converted to document viewer
        
        
        Dexterity support
        -----------------
        
        If you want to use it with your own Dexterity content type. You need to edit
        the fti in ZMI/portal_types/yourtype to add "documentviewer" in
        the available view methods and to set the primary field in the schema,
        for example::
        
            <field name="myfile" marshal:primary="true"
                   type="plone.namedfile.field.NamedBlobFile">
        
        
        File storage integration
        ------------------------
        
        If you choose to use basic file storage instead of zodb blob storage,
        there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind.
        
        1) Use nginx to then serve the file system files. This might require
           you install a local nginx just for serving file storage on the
           plone server. You can get creative with how your file storage
           is used though.
        
        2) Since in plone's delete operation, it can be interrupted and the deletion
           of a file on the OS system system can not be done within a transaction,
           no files are ever deleted. However, there is an action you can
           put in a cron task to clean up your file storage directory. Just call the
           url `http://zeoinstace/plone/@@dvcleanup-filestorage`.
        
        
        Upgrading from page turner
        --------------------------
        
        If you currently have page turner installed, this project will supercede 
        it. Your page turner views will work but no future files added to the site
        will be converted to page turner.
        
        To convert existing view, on every page turner enabled file, there will
        be a button `Document Viewer Convert` that you can click to manually
        convert page turner to document viewer.
        
        To convert all existing views, go to portal_setup in the zmi, upgrades,
        select collective.documentviewer, click to show old upgrades and there
        should be an `upgrade-all` step to run.
        
        
        Upgrading from pdfpal
        ---------------------
        
        If you want to upgrade from pdfpal, it is recommended that you simply
        uninstall pdf pal.
        
        Document viewer will disable parts of pdfpal if installed with it
        otherwise. If you still want both installed, you'll need to upgrade
        to at least version 0.7b5 in order for it to play nice with document
        viewer.
        
        Also, version 0.7b6 has the best uninstall support so if you're going
        to uninstall the product, first upgrade your egg to 0.7b6.
        
        
        Installation on Cent OS/Red hat
        -------------------------------
        
        Special instructions for centos have been contributed by Eric Tyrer.
        You can access them via `the git hub repo file location <https://github.com/collective/collective.documentviewer/blob/master/CENTOS-INSTALL.rst>`_.
        
        Installation
        -------------------------------
        If on a linux/ubuntu/debian machine you run into an error like::
        
            /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/docsplit-0.7.2/lib/docsplit/image_extractor.rb:51:in `exists?': can't convert nil into String (TypeError)
            from /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/docsplit-0.7.2/lib/docsplit/image_extractor.rb:51:in `ensure in convert'
        
        This is because the ruby docsplit library is having an issue with the temp
        folder accesses, and removal of temp files.   Just run the following command::
        
            sudo chmod 1777 /tmp && sudo chmod 1777 /var/tmp
        
        And retry the conversion of your document
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - check why there are some error during async operations:
            - ConflictError: database conflict error (oid 0x4d10, class BTrees.IOBTree.IOBucket, serial this txn started with 0x0395f478bc2cb377 2012-04-21 03:36:44.103425, serial currently committed 0x0395f479b09de4cc 2012-04-21 03:37:41.394556)
            - ERROR ZODB.Connection Shouldn't load state for 0x319d when the connection is closed
