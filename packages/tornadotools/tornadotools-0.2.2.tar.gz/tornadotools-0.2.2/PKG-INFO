        Tornado Tools
        =============
        
        This is a small project collecting my personal *best practices* and *goodies*
        for my work with Tornado_.
        
        Basically there are two types of code in here:
        
        1. Libraries. Some are simply collected (like adisp_), some are selfwritten
            (like the `Monrel2 Handler <http://truemped.github.com/tornadotools/mongrel2.html>`_)
        2. Python decorators. Mostly they are little code snippets doing something
            useful and enhancing Tornado_ in a (hopefully) useful way.
        
        Detailed usage is can be found in the documentation_.
        
        Getting started with the code
        =============================
        
        To get an idea of the code, have a look and the documentation_. Then you should
        know what *buildout* is and does. Finally you should be familiar with some kind
        of editor...

        I should use the *BSD* or *MIT* license, but then I had to change all code
        headers...
