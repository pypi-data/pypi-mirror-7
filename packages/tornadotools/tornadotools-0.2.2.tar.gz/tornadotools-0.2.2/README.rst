Tornado Tools
=============

This is a small project collecting my personal *best practices* and *goodies*
for my work with Tornado_.

Basically there are two types of code in here:

1. Libraries. Some are simply collected (like adisp_), some are selfwritten
    (like the `Monrel2 Handler <http://truemped.github.com/tornadotools/mongrel2.html>`_)
2. Python decorators. Mostly they are little code snippets doing something
    useful and enhancing Tornado_ in a (hopefully) useful way.

Detailed usage is can be found in the documentation_.

Getting started with the code
=============================

To get an idea of the code, have a look and the documentation_. Then you should
know what *buildout* is and does. Finally you should be familiar with some kind
of editor...


License
=======

Currently everything is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2**. Maybe
I should use the *BSD* or *MIT* license, but then I had to change all code
headers...
