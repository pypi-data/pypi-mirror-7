        A lot of good ideas were taken from `Pyramid <http://www.pylonsproject.org>`_ itself and from different repoze software.
        The code itself was written as part of the `VoteIT project <http://www.voteit.se>`_.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.3.1b (2014-05-05)
        -------------------
        
        - Unicode wasn't an allowed string-type... (Brown paperbag for me) [robinharms]
        
        0.3b (2014-03-19)
        -----------------
        
        - View groups don't catch exceptions any longer. This was a cause of a lot of
          odd error messages on Python 2.
        - Ordering with bad keys don't cause exceptions - they're logged as warnings instead.
        - New argument priority for view actions. [ixmatus]
        
        
        0.2b (2013-06-18)
        -----------------
        
        -  Python3 support fixed by pib (Paul Bonser) - thanks a lot!
        -  Fetch and execution of vas changed - empty result should be ignored,
           and yield isn't used now. This should make error messages clearer. [robinharms]
        -  Checks for containment, interface, permission etc moved to ViewAction object, since
           they weren't performed if the object was called directly. [robinharms]
