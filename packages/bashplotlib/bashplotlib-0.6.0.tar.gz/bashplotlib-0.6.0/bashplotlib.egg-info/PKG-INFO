        ## what is it?
        bashplotlib is a python package and command line tool for making basic plots in the terminal. It's a quick way to visualize data when you don't have a GUI. It's written in pure python and can quickly be installed anywhere using pip.
        
        ## installation
        ### install with pip
        ```
        $ pip install bashplotlib
        ```
        ### install from source
        ```
        $ git clone git@github.com:glamp/bashplotlib.git
        $ cd bashplotlib
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Either method will install the bashplotlib python package and will also add <code>hist</code> and <code>scatter</code> 
        to your python scripts folder. This folder should be on your path (add it if it's not).
        
        ## features
        
        - quick plotting from the command line
        - customize the color, size, title, and shape of plots
        - pipe data into plots with stdin
        
        
        ## usage
        ### command line
        <code>hist</code> takes input from either stdin or specified using the -f parameter. Input should be a single column of numbers.

        <code>scatter</code> takes x and y coordinates as input form either a comma delimited file using -f or from 2 different files using -x and -y.

        ### in python
        If you want to use bashplotlib from python, just import histogram and scatterplot.
        ```
        from bashplotlib.scatterplot import plot_scatter
        ```

        ```
        from bashplotlib.histogram import plot_hist
        ```
        <img src="examples/img/histogramhelp.png">
        
        ##examples
        ```
        $ scatter --file data/texas.txt --pch .
        ```
        <img src="examples/img/texas.png">
        
        ```
        $ hist --file data/exp.txt
        ```
        <img src="examples/img/histogram.png">
        
        ```
        $ scatter -x data/x_test.txt -y data/y_test.txt
        ```
        <img src="examples/img/scatter.png">
        
        ##todo
        
        - sideways numbers for x-axis of histograms
        - colors for individual points
        - line charts
        - trendlines
