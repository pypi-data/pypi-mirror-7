        ==================
        
        
        
        [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/teonite/deployment/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/teonite/deployment/latest)
        
        
        
        We have tried various deployment tools and since Python is your main choice
        
        regarding language/technology we used Fabric most. But as always regarding
        
        motivation to create a new tool, not all tools meet our expectations.
        
        
        
        So we've created our own deployment tool based on Fabric (it uses Fabric to do
        
        all operations on the remote server).
