Bambu Markup
============

Replacements for Django's Markdown and reStructuredText support

About Bambu Tools 2.0
---------------------

This is part of a toolset called Bambu Tools. It's being moved from a
namespace of ``bambu`` to its own 'root-level' package, along with all
the other tools in the set. If you're upgrading from a version prior to
2.0, please make sure to update your code to use ``bambu_markup`` rather
than ``bambu.markup``.

Installation
------------

Install the package via Pip:

::

    pip install bambu-markup

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'bambu_markup'
    )

Settings
--------

Set ``MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS`` to a list of MArkdown extensions in order to
further filter Markdown text.

Set ``MARKDOWN_ENABLE_ATTRIBUTES`` to ``True`` to enable HTML
attributes.
