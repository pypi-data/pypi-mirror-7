Sentry
******

`Sentry <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sentry>`_ support is baked into pylytics.

Just add the following line to your settings.py file::

    SENTRY_DSN = "https://my_sentry_server.com/project_id"

For more information about the Sentry DSN format, see the `Raven docs <http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config/#the-sentry-dsn>`_.
