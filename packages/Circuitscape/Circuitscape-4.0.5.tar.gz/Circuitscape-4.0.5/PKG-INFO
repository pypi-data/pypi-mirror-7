Description: Circuitscape v4
        ---------------
        
        Circuitscape is a free, open-source program which borrows algorithms
        from electronic circuit theory to predict patterns of movement, gene
        flow, and genetic differentiation among plant and animal populations in
        heterogeneous landscapes. Circuit theory complements least-cost path
        approaches because it considers effects of all possible pathways across
        a landscape simultaneously. We are developing Circuitscape for Mac OS X,
        Windows, and Linux.
