Submitting a Bug
================

If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is either already reported at 

https://github.com/geier/khal/issues?state=open


If it isn't, always run the command again with the --debug option
and paste the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details like your username and resource). 

Also, it is often helpful if you include which OS you are on, which
version of python and, in the case the problems occur during sync, which
version of requests you are using. You can just run the file at
https://gist.github.com/geier/5814123#file-debug_helper-py and paste the
output.

If the error occurs during sync, please also supply details on your
CalDAV server (which server and version).


Hacking

If you want to hack on khal and have some questions, please don't

you need. If you want to implement some larger features, it's probably
best to contact me first and see if me or somebody else is already
working on it.
