        Beeswarm is a honeypot project which provides easy configuration, deployment and managment of honeypots.
        Beeswarm operates by deploying fake end-user systems (clients) and services (honeypots). Beeswarm uses these systems to provides
        IoC (Indication of Compromise) by observing the difference between expected and actual traffic. 
        An IoC could be a certificate mismatch or the unexpected reuse of credentials (honeytokens).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Beeswarm is packaged as a regular python module, and follows normal installation methodology:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $>python setup.py install
        
        
        Developers are encouraged to use the develop feature from distribute:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $>python setup.py develop
        
        
        Starting the server
        
        Starting the server
        -------------------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            $> mkdir server_workdir
        	$> beeswarm --se
        	*** Please answer a few configuration options ***
        	2014-05-03 23:25:29,516 (root) Beeswarm server has been configured using default ssl parameters and network configuration, this could be used to fingerprint the beeswarm server. If you want to customize these options please use the --customize options on first startup.
        	2014-05-03 23:25:29,516 (beeswarm.shared.helpers) Creating SSL Certificate and Key.
        
        	* Communication between drones (honeypots and clients) and server *
        	* Please make sure that drones can always contact the Beeswarm server using the information that you are about to enter. *
        	IP or hostname of server: 192.168.1.147
        	2014-05-03 23:25:46,024 (beeswarm.server.webapp.auth) Created default admin account for the beeswarm server.
