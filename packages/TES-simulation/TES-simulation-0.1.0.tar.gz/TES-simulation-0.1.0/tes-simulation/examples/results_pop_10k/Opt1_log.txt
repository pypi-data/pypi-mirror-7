  ...testing sequence of income targets, please wait...


 ********************* Results for Examine Option 1 *********************
income_target_total (target_end) needed for 90% of families to choose Option 1 = 110,988 T&D
90th percentile base family income = $104,882

resulting post-CBFS family income @ threshold = 108,239 T&D
post-CBFS mean family income (100% of population) @ income_target_total = 115,909 T&D

  
  ********************* 
  Set Config.preliminary_graphs_Option_1=False to run simulation.  
  
  Change Config.target_end to match target_end calculated here (if desired).  
  
  Change Config.threshold_for_membership_family to match 90th percentile base family income (if desired). 
  
  Re-run examineOption1() if earmarks in Config change, or if Config.TSI_max or Config.incentive change.
  Make sure that Config.earmark_nurture is greater than "fraction below family threshold that are NIWF or
  unemployed" calculated in countyInfo(), or else nurture funds will run dry.
