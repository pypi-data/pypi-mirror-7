Description: Detach
        ======
        Fork and detach the current process.
        
        Usage
        -----
        The `detach` package contains a context manager called `Detach`. It is used
        with with `with` statement to fork the current process and execute code in that
        process. The child process exits when the context manager exits. The following
        parameters may be passed to `Detach` to change its behavior:
        
        * `stdout` - Redirect child stdout to this stream.
        * `stderr` - Redirect child stderr to this stream.
        * `stdin` - Redirect his stream to child stdin.
        * `close_fds` - Close all file descriptors in the child excluding stdio.
        * `exclude_fds` - Do not close these file descriptors if close_fds is `True`.
        * `daemonize` - Exit the parent process when the context manager exits.
        
        Examples
        --------
        ### Simple Fork with STDOUT
        
            import os, detach
        
            with detach.Detach(sys.stdout) as d:
                if d.pid:
                    print("forked child with pid {}".format(d.pid))
                else:
                    print("hello from child process {}".format(os.getpid()))
        
        ### Daemonize 
        
            import os, detach
            from your_app import main
        
            def main():
                """Your daemon code here."""
        
            with detach.Detach(daemonize=True) as d:
                if d.pid:
                    print("started process in background")
                else:
                    main()
