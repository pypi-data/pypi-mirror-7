Description: Cheesemaker
        ===========
        
        A minimalistic image viewer using Python3 and Qt5.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        At the moment, Cheesemaker supports zoom, fullscreen, rotating and
        flipping images, automatic orientation, and resizing and cropping
        images. You can also open images in multiple windows.
        
        There is no menubar or toolbar, but you can access the menu by
        right-clicking on the window. There are also keyboard shortcuts for most
        actions. In addition, you can now access some functions by clicking on
        different parts of the window. For example, if you click near the right
        edge of the image, it will go to the next image in the folder. The mouse
        and keyboard shortcuts are all listed in the help page.
        
        There is a slideshow, which can show random images or show the images in
        order. This option can also be changed while the slideshow is running.
        The screensaver is disabled while the slideshow is running.
        
        You can save images, and the image (exif) data will be saved. However,
        the orientation data will be rewritten, so that the next time you open
        the image it will appear the same way.
        
        The preferences (automatic orientation, slideshow time delay and jpeg
        image quality) are saved for the next time you use Cheesemaker.
        
        Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Cheesemaker depends on python3, python3-pyqt5, python3-gobject
        (python3-gi), and libgexiv2 (gir1.2-gexiv2).
