Cheesemaker
===========

A simple image viewer using Python 3 and Qt5.

What's so special about Cheesemaker?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, Cheesemaker supports zoom, fullscreen, rotating and
flipping images, automatic orientation, and resizing and cropping
images. You can also open images in multiple windows.

There is no menubar or toolbar, but you can access the menu by
right-clicking on the window. There are also keyboard shortcuts for most
actions. In addition, you can now access some functions by clicking on
different parts of the window. For example, if you click near the right
edge of the image, it will go to the next image in the folder. The mouse
and keyboard shortcuts are all listed in the help page.

There is a slideshow, which can show random images or show the images in
order. This option can also be changed while the slideshow is running.
The screensaver is disabled while the slideshow is running.

You can save images, and the image (exif) data will be saved. However,
the orientation data will be rewritten, so that the next time you open
the image it will appear the same way.

The preferences (automatic orientation, slideshow time delay and jpeg
image quality) are saved for the next time you use Cheesemaker.

TODO
~~~~

-  Make it faster.
-  Put my feet up and relax.
-  Maybe add more basic editing functionality.
-  Maybe improve auto-orientation.
-  Take it easy for a while.
