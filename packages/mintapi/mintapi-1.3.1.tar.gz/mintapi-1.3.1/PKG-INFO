Description: mintapi
        =======
        
        a screen-scraping API for Mint.com.
        
        Requirements
        ===
        Ensure you have Python 2 or 3 and pip (`easy_install pip`) and then:
        
            pip install mintapi
        
        Usage
        ===
        
        from Python
        ---
        From python, simply call `get_accounts`. We recommend using the
        `keyring` library for persisting credentials.
        
            import mintapi
            accounts = mintapi.get_accounts(email, password)
        
        from anywhere
        ---
        Run it as a sub-process from your favorite language; `pip install mintapi` creates a binary in your $PATH. From the command-line, the output is JSON:
        
            >>> mintapi email password
            [
              {
                "accountName": "Chase Checking", 
                "lastUpdatedInString": "25 minutes", 
                "accountType": "bank", 
                "currentBalance": 100.12,
                ...
              },
              ...
            ]
        
        If you need to avoid using pip or setup.py, you can also clone/download
        this repository and run: `python mintapi/api.py email password`
