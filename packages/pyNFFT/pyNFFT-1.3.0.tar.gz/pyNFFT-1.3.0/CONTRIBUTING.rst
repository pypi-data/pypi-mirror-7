How to contribute to pyNFFT
===========================

Please feel free to [open issues][] and send pull requests on GitHub. When sending a pull request, please create a new feature branch, and send your pull
request from that branch. Please do *not* send pull requests from your `master`
branch because to avoid potential merge conflicts.

Improving features
-----------------

The NFFT library contains a lot more features than the pyNFFT wrapper supports
at the moment. If you are interested in developping one of these features, feel
free to get coding and send me your contribution for inclusion to the project.

Coding style
------------

This project follows the PEP8 coding guidelines. Please make sure your code has been tested with a code analysis tool such as `pyflakes <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes>`_ and `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_ before submitting it.
