IVisual
===========

IVisual provides VPython visual API for inline use in an IPython Notebook. You might find
it most useful for performing 3D visualizations of VPython visual simulations that can be 
viewed inline in an IPython Notebook. Typical usage
often looks like this::

    Start an IPython Notebook

    from ivisual import *

    s = sphere()


The above will produce an interactive 3D window containing a sphere.


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
