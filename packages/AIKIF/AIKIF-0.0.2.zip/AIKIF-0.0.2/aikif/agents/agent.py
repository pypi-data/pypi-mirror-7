# Agent.py	written by Duncan Murray 21/4/2014
# Base class for agents in AIKIF
# This class manages the starting and stopping of agents, 
# so it is the interface to whatever method will be used
#  (e.g. mail, http, # subprocess, ?)
# USAGE - e.g. test_agent.py
		# from agent import Agent
		# class TestAgent(Agent):
		# 	def __init__(self, *arg):
		# 		Agent.__init__(self, *arg)
		#
		# def main():
		# 	test = TestAgent('hello',  os.getcwd())
		# 	test.start()
		# 	print(test.check_status())
		# 	print(test.report())
#import sys
#sys.path.append('..//..//AI')
#sys.path.append('..//..//..//aspytk')
#import aikif.AIKIF_utils as aikif
#import aikif.fileMapping as filemap 
		
agent_status = [  	'NONE',				# agent was never instantiated (then how would it report this?)
					'RUNNING', 			# agent is running
					'STOPPED', 		    # agent was stopped - not sure if it finished or not
					'FINISHED', 		# agent has finished performing its task, ready to report
					'READY', 			# agent has reported its results back, and is ready for next command
					'WAITING', 			# agent is running, but waiting on other input
					'ERROR', 			# agent has encountered an error it cannot handle
