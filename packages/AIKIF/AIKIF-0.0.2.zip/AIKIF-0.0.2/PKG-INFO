Description: AIKIF - Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework
        *NOTE - this is very much an experimental work in progress* 
        - the code runs, but wont do anything useful at this stage
        
        Overview
        This is an example framework to capture the flow of information initially for personal data management, but ultimately useful for AI applications.
        Initially it will be populated and tested for human use, but includes tests and verification process for future ‘General AI’s.
        Functions (Octave, Python, SQL) are called at set stages of the AI process which log the results into a standard database schema.
        
        
        Quick Start
        The goal is to get any set of information and parse it into a consistent format so a machine can read it.
        For example:
        	Project Management
            Code Management
            Personal Information Management
        
        Programs
        ========
        Main Programs
        AI.py			- sample main program to show a trivial example of logging data
        view.py			- simple command driven procedure to show various details of the system
        index.py		- creates text indexes of all the files
        search.py		- searches, using both indexes and ontologies
        go_web_aikif.bat- starts the web server for the AIKIF admin interface
        
        Toolbox
        Various modules which contain generic functions
        
        DataTools
        collection of modules to manage data transformations
        
        Standard Library Programs
        AIKIF_utils.py	- standard utils for the filelists
        fileMapping.py	- main routine that decides what the output files will be called
        security.py		- manages security, which will allow users to have private data (not the norm for this)
        
        Data Load programs
        These programs are used to load a specific dataset, the code used to parse each file is in a separate load procedure
        processRawData.py			- this calls all data load programs and logs results
        create_word_lists.py		- loads a list of nouns, verbs, adjectives from web into local structures
        loadCountry_Gdeltproject.py	- loads a country reference file
        loadPIM_Filelist.py			- loads a list of local files into objects, events, photos
        loadPIM_shopping.py			- sample to show how a personal shopping list is loaded
