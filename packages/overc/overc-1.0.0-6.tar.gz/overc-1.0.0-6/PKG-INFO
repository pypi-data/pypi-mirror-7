Description: OverC
        =====
        
        OverC (pronounced: oversee): simplistic monitoring solution that is a pleasure to use.
        
        Features:
        
        * Simplicity is the root of all genius: easy to configure and use
        * Dynamic and extensible: everything is a plugin, in any scripting language
        * Agent-less: data is pushed to OverC server
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Sending Data
        ============
        
        OverC uses an extremely simple JSON protocol to report arbitrary monitoring data.
        You can use the API as you like, but there also is a [command-line overcli tool](#overcli) available
        which offers a complete solution.
        
        In general, the following HTTP codes can be sent in response:
        
        In response, you get one of the following HTTP codes:
        
        * `200`: success
        * `400`: malformed request (e.g. not enough data provided)
        * `403`: authentication failed (e.g. wrong server key)
        
        Ping
        ----
        
        Checks whether the connection works fine:
        
        ```json
        {
          "server": { "name": "localhost", "key": "1234" }
        }
        ```
        
        In addition to connection-checking, it also tests server authentication.
        Proceed to the next section for more information.
        
        Reporting Services
        ------------------
        
        OverC does not connect to anything: all data should be POSTed to it as JSON to `/api/set/service/status`:
        
        ```json
        {
          "server": { "name": "localhost", "key": "1234" },
          "period": 60,
          "services": [
            { "name": "application", "state": "OK", "info": "up 32h" },
            { "name": "cpu", "state": "OK", "info": "28% load" },
            { "name": "queue", "state": "OK", "info": "3 items" },
          ]
        }
        ```
        
        Keys explained:
        
        * `"server"` is the *Server* identification.
          
          Whenever a Server reports for the first time, OverC remembers it and stores its name and access key. 
          Subsequent connections are only authorized if the same server key is used.
          
          You can provide any name/key pair for the server identification: the server is automatically registered at OverC.
          Just make sure you keep using the same identification pair: if you try to send a key that's different from the one 
          that was used initially, you'll get an `403 Forbidden` error in response.
        
        * `"period"` is the reporting period in seconds the server promises to keep.
          
          If any of the services do not report within the declared period -- an alert is raised.
          
        * `"services"` is the list of *Services* and their current *States*.
        
            Each Service has a `"name"` which should not be changed.
            
            For each Service, the current State is reported: `"state"` is a string which supports one of the following values:
                
            * `"OK"`: service runs fine
            * `"WARN"`: warning condition
            * `"ERR"`: critical error condition
            * `"UNK"`: unknown, which probably means that its state cannot be retrieved.
            * Any other string is converted to `"UNK"`.
            
            Any additional information can be reported with `"info"`: arbitrary string with runtime data.
        
        Note that there's no need to explicitly define Servers and Services: all data is accepted automatically.
        
        
        
        Reporting Alerts
        ----------------
        
        It's possible to send alerts directly by pushing JSON object to `/api/set/alerts`:
        
        ```json
        {
          "server": { "name": "localhost", "key": "1234" },
          "alerts": [
            { "message": "System down" },
            { "message": "System down" },
            { "message": "Cannot check state for service A", "service": "queue" },
          ]
        }
        ```
        
        If you want to alert about something happened with a particular service, use the "service" key to specify its name.
        
        Keys explained:
        
        * `"server"` is the *Server* identification.
        * `"alerts"` is the list of alerts you'd like to report
            
            * `"message"`: alert message text
            * `"service"`: (optional) service name to report the alert for, if any.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Overcli
        =======
        
        OverC comes with a command-line client utility which allows to interact with OverC server.
        
        Two main arguments are:
        
        * `-s`, `--server`: OverC server URL. Example: `http://localhost:5000/`
        * `-i`, `--server-id`: Server identification, `<server-name>:<server-key>`. Example: 'localhost:1234'.
            
              Identification pair is arbitrary, just keep using the same key.
        
        This way, most commands are invoked like this:
        
            $ overcli -s 'http://localhost:5000' -i 'localhost:1234' <command-name> [arguments...]
            
        Example: use `ping` to test the connection:
        
            $ overcli -s 'http://localhost:5000' -i 'localhost:1234' ping
            
        Example: report single service's state:
        
            $ overcli -s 'http://localhost:5000' -i 'localhost:1234' service-status 60 'app' 'OK' 'Runs fine'
            
        Example: report a single alert:
        
            $ overcli -s 'http://localhost:5000' -i 'localhost:1234' alert "Something bad has happened"
            
            
            
        Continuous Monitoring
        ---------------------
        
        The tools described above are just thin wrappers around the HTTP JSON client and are probably not enough for real
        monitoring challenges. Using `overcli`, you can set up continuous monitoring for your services using simple scripts.
        
        First, create the configuration file (anywhere):
        
        ```ini
        [service:app]
        period=5
        command=./plugin.d/app.sh
        
        [service:que]
        period=10
        command=./plugin.d/que.sh
        
        [service:cpu]
        period=10
        command=./plugin.d/cpu.sh
        
        [service:echo]
        period=5
        command=echo 1
        ```
        
        * Section `[service:<name>]` defines a service to be monitored and reported
            
            * `period` is the time period in seconds defining how often the service status should be reported
            * `command` -- an arbitrary command that tests your service: monitoring plugin.
                
                The command should be a script which prints out the service info, and its return code defines the status:
                
                | Code | Status |
                |------|--------|
                | 0    | OK     |
                | 1    | WARN   |
                | 2    | FAIL   |
                | >= 3 | UNK    |
                
                Any other code is also converted to `"UNK"`.
                
                *NOTE*: This actually follows [Nagios Plugin API](http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/pluginapi.html), so they are reusable! :)
        
        Having this config file, just launch the monitor:
        
            $ overcli -s 'http://localhost:5000' -i 'localhost:1234' monitor config.ini
        
        All service states will be updated immediately, and continuously monitored ever since.
        Any fatal exceptions are reported as alerts to the monitoring server.
        
        For the sake of completeness, here's an example plugin which simply checks whether a process is running:
        
        ```bash
        #! /usr/bin/env bash
        applicaton_name="$1"
        
        # Try to get PID of the running application, or die with code 2 ("FAIL")
        application_pid=$(pidof $applicaton_name) || { echo 'Not running!' ; exit 2 }
        
        # Running fine: print PID, exit with 0 ("OK")
        echo "PID: $application_pid"
        exit 0
        ```
        
        Then use it like this:
        
            command=./plugin.d/pid-check.sh "httpd"
