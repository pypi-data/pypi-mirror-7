Description: Django Outlets
        ==============
        
        A reusable Django app that allows you to manage and display your stores.
        
        If you e.g. have different outlets, where you sell your products and those
        scattered across the world's surface, you can provide easy access to the
        customer about where they can find them.
        
        The app includes simple management of countries and outlets and a google map
        integration. For integration into the great ``django-cms``, see `cmsplugin-django-outlets <https://github.com/bitmazk/cmsplugin-django-outlets>`_.
        
        Installation

        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install django-outlets
        
            # optional if you want cms integration
            pip install cmsplugin-django-outlets

            pip install -e git+git://github.com/bitmazk/django-outlets.git#egg=outlets
        
        Add ``outlets`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'outlets',
                # again just if you want cms integration add the following
                'cmsplugin_outlets',
            )
        
        Add the ``outlets`` URLs to your ``urls.py``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...
                url(r'^outlets/', include('outlets.urls')),
            )

        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ./manage.py migrate outlets
            # and another optional line. You guessed it. Only if you require it to work
            # in django-cms.
            ./manage.py migrate cmsplugin_outlets
