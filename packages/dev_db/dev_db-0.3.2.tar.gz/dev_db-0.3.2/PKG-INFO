Description: Django development database
        ===========================
        
        Tool to automatically create a development database for local development by sampling your production database.
        It maintains referential integrity by looking up the dependencies for the selected rows.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        ```bash
          sudo pip install dev_db
        ```
        
        Add dev_db to your installed apps
        
        Customize the CreateDevDB class
        
        ```python
        DEV_DB_CREATOR = 'dev_db.creator.DevDBCreator'
        # for fashiolista
        DEV_DB_CREATOR = 'framework.dev_db_creator.FashiolistaDBCreator'
        ```
        
        
        Creating the data
        =================
        
        ```bash
          python manage.py create_dev_db -o ../development_data.json
          gzip ../development_data.json
        ```
        
        Creating the test fixture takes about 5-10 minutes
        
        Loading the data
        ================
        
        start with an empty db on local called 
        test_fashiolista_local
        
        1. python manage.py syncdb --all --noinput
        2. python manage.py migrate --fake --noinput
        3. Truncate contenttype and permission tables
        4. python manage.py loaddata ../development_data.json.gz --traceback -v2
        
        These four steps are also wrapped in the load_dev_db command. So simply run
        (This assumes you don't have the database yet, it wont drop it for you)
        
        ```bash
          python manage.py load_dev_db
        ```
        
        Loading the fixture takes about 2 minutes
        
        (be sure to run pgtune on your local postgres, otherwise it might take longer)
        
        
        Running tests
        =============
        
        From the dev_db_example directory run
        
        ```bash
        	python manage.py test dev_db
        ```
