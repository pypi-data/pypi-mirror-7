Description: # HockeyApp Python CLI
        Written by Benjamin Wallis 2014
        
        ## Overiew
        This is a simple python based command line interface for interfacing with the HockeyApp web API. It's pretty straight forward!
        
        ## Setup
        To setup and install both the python packages and the cli itself, simply run setuptools using the following command:
        
        ```
            sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        It's just that easy! I can't think of anything else to put here for the time being, so for now, here is a picture of a cat stuck in a cardboard box:
