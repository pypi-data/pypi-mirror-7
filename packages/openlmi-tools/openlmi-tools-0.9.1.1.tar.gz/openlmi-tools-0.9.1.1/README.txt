openlmi-scripts
===============

Client-side python modules and command line utilities.

It comprises of one binary called ``lmi`` and a common library. ``lmi``
meta-command allows to run commands on a set of OpenLMI providers. These
commands can be installed separately in a modular way.

``lmi`` is a command line application allowing to run single command on
a set of hosts with just one statement from ``shell`` or it can run in
an interactive way.

For more information please refer to online documentation on
`pythonhosted <http://pythonhosted.org/openlmi-scripts/index.html>`__ or
build your own in ``doc/`` directory.

Dependencies
------------

Code base is written for ``python 2.7``. There are following python
dependencies:

-  python-docopt

Uploading to PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since *PyPI* expects README file to be in a *reStructuredText* markup
language and the one present is written in *markdown*, it needs to be
converted to it. So please make sure you have ``pandoc`` installed
before running:

::

    $ python setup.py sdist upload

Installation
------------

Use standard ``setuptools`` script for installation:

::

    $ cd openlmi-scripts
    $ python setup.py install --user

This installs just the *lmi meta-command* and client-side library. To
install subcommands, you need to do the same procedure for each
particular command under ``commands/`` directory.

Script eggs are also available on *PyPI*, install them with:

::

    $ pip install --user openlmi-scripts
    $ # add any provider you want to interact with
    $ pip install --user openlmi-scripts-service openlmi-scripts-software

Usage
-----

To get a help and see available commands, run:

::

    $ lmi help

To get a help for particular command, run:

::

    $ lmi help service

To issue single command on a host, run:

::

    $ lmi --host ${hostname} service list

To start the app in interactive mode:

::

    $ lmi --host ${hostname}
    > service list --disabled
    ...
    > service start svnserve.service
    ...
    > quit

Developing lmi scripts.
-----------------------

This documents how to quickly develop lmi scripts without the need to
reinstall python eggs, when anything is changed. This presumes, that the
development process takes place in a git repotory checked out from
`git <https://github.com/openlmi/openlmi-scripts>`__. It can be located
anywhere on system.

Before we start with setting up an environment, please double check,
that you don't have installed anything from openlmi-scripts in system
path (``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lmi/scripts`` should not
exist). And make sure, that user path is also cleared:

::

    $ rm -rf $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lmi*
    $ rm -rf $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/openlmi*

Install all dependencies:

-  python-docopt
-  openlmi-python-base
-  openlmi-tools

Either via rpms or from respective git repositories. For
openlmi-python-base package contained in
`providers-git <https://fedorahosted.org/openlmi/browser/openlmi-providers>`__
repository the setup script is located at ``src/python/setup.py``. In
future these will be available from PyPi.

Let's setup an environment:

1. Create a workspace directory for current ``$USER`` (let's call it a
   ``WSP``). This is a place, where our eggs and binaries will be
   "installed". It can be located anywhere, for example:

   ::

       $ WSP=~/.python_workspace
       $ mkdir $WSP

2. Add workspace to your python path to make all modules installed there
   importable (you can add this to your ``~/.bashrc``):

   ::

       $ export PYTHONPATH=$WSP:$PYTHONPATH

3. Add workspace to your PATH, so the installed binaries can be run:

   ::

       $ export PATH=$WSP:$PATH

4. Now let's "install" to our workspace. First ``cd`` to checked out
   openlmi-scripts repository.
5. Install them and any commands you want -- possibly your own

   ::

       $ python setup.py develop --install-dir=$WSP
       $ for cmd in service storage; do
       >     pushd commands/$cmd
       >     python setup.py develop --install-dir=$WSP
       >     popd
       > done

Now any change made to openlmi-scripts is immediately reflected in
``lmi`` meta-command.
