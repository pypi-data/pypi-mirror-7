                      emphasize expressions in stdout


~ What is Em?

  Em is a terminal tool that prints FILE(s) or standard input to standard
  output and highlights the expressions that are matching the PATTERN.

  The expression will be highlighted iff stdout refers to the tty and that
  tty is ANSI-compatible.


~ Why the name Em?

  The name is an abbreviation of emphasize, a synonym of highlight. BTW,
  it's easy to write and it's easy to remember since HTML has <em> tag
  with similar meaning.


~ Requirements?

  The terminal must be ANSI-compatible. This criterion is met by most
  popular terminal emulators on Linux, Unix and MacOS.

  Also, you need Python 2.6, Python 3.2 or above to run Em.


~ How to install?

      $ [sudo] pip install em


~ How to use?

  The most practical usecase for me:

      $ tail -f /path/to/log | em "ERROR" -f red | em "WARNING" -f yellow

  See the documentations for details: http://em.readthedocs.org/.
