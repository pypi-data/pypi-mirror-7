### PyBreweryDB

This is a Python wrapper around the BreweryDB API.  It is a work in progress with
only a handful of endpoints implemented at this point.

Pre-release builds are available on Github only at this point.  Future builds
will be released on Pypi.

This API wrapper is changing frequently until it arrives in a 1.0 state.

### Supported Objects

Currently this wrapper supports

* Beers
* Breweries

Planned Support for

* Locations
* Styles

I'm working on adding more but...

If you want to add more endpoints and objects, fork this project and submit a PR!
