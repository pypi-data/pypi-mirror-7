deb-pkg-tools: Debian packaging tools
=====================================

The Python package `deb-pkg-tools` is a collection of functions to work with
Debian packages and repositories. Some of those functions have a command line
interface (see below) because they're very convenient to use in shell scripts,
while other functions are meant to be called directly from Python code.

Status
------

On the one hand the `deb-pkg-tools` package is based on my experiences with
Debian packages and repositories over the past couple of years, on the other
hand `deb-pkg-tools` itself is quite young. Then again most functionality is
covered by automated tests; at the time of writing coverage is around 90% (some
of the error handling is quite tricky to test if we also want to test the
non-error case, which is of course the main focus :-)

Installation and usage
----------------------

You can install the `deb-pkg-tools` package using the following command::

    $ pip install deb-pkg-tools

After installation you'll have the ``deb-pkg-tools`` program available::

    $ deb-pkg-tools --help
    Usage: deb-pkg-tools [OPTIONS]

    Supported options:

      -i, --inspect=FILE          inspect the metadata in a *.deb archive
      -b, --build=DIR             build a Debian package with `dpkg-deb --build'
      -u, --update-repo=DIR       create/update a trivial package repository
      -a, --activate-repo=DIR     enable `apt-get' to install packages from a
                                  trivial repository (requires root/sudo privilege)
      -d, --deactivate-repo=DIR   cleans up after --activate-repo
                                  (requires root/sudo privilege)
      -w, --with-repo=DIR CMD...  create/update a trivial package repository,
                                  activate the repository, run the positional
                                  arguments as an external command (usually `apt-get
                                  install') and finally deactivate the repository
      -v, --verbose               make more noise
      -h, --help                  show this message and exit

One thing to note is that the operation of ``deb-pkg-tools --update-repo`` can
be influenced by a configuration file. For details about this, please refer to
the documentation on `deb_pkg_tools.repo.select_gpg_key()`_.

If you're interested in using `deb-pkg-tools` as a Python module, please refer
to the function reference on `Read the Docs`_.

Dependencies
------------

The `deb-pkg-tools` package depends on the python-debian_ package for control
file parsing. The following external programs are also required (depending on
which functionality you need of course):
