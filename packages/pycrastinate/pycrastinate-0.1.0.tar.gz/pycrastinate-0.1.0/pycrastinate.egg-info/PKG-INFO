Description: Pycrastinate
        =======================
        **TODO less, DO more**: *Keep your code clean without changing the way you code.*
        
        Tired of `TODO` from people who have not touched that code in years? What about `FIXME`?
        
        Pycrastinate is a **language-agnostic** tool that helps you keep your codebase (whether it is legacy or new) under control in a transparent way.
        
        Usage
        ============
        Try it out
        ----------------
        It simply works out of the box! If you want to run it within another python script do the following:
        
        *from pycrastinate import pycrastinate*
        *pycrastinate("full_path_to_your_config_file/config_name.py")*
        
        If you want to run it as a command line tool just run `python pycrastinate.py path_to_your_config/config.py` inside its root directory and experience the magic. You can get sample config.py and config_not_git.py files from https://github.com/isaacbernat/pycrastinate
        
        Dive in
        ----------------
        Pycrastinate was featured in a 25-minute talk in PyCon Sweden 2014. There you can find the PDF and the original version http://2014.pycon.se/ . The slides include real life use-case examples.
        
        Tune it
        ----------------
        Create your own config file. Change the `root_paths` for whichever paths hold the files you want to analyse, the `file_sufixes` to include only those that you want (e.g. only python files), the `tokens` that should be considered (e.g. `TODO`), their case-sensitivity, etc. and then store it on the root path for pycrastinate. The config name must not have any "." besides de final ".py" and you can use it by running `python pycrastinate.py your_config_name`
        
        Master it
        ----------------
        It is highly encouraged to read at least the succint github documentation and check the slides from PyCon Sweden 2014 if you plan to use pycrastinate seriously.
