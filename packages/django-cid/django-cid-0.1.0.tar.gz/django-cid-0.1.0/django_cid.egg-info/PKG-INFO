        Logging is important. Anyone who has had a call at 3am to say the site is down
        knows this. Without quality logging it is almost impossible to work out what
        on earth is happening.
        
        Even with plenty of logs it can be hard to track down exactly what the effects
        of a particular request are. Enter Django Correlation IDs. The approach
        is quite a simple one. Incoming requests are assigned a unique id (a uuid).
        This can either happen in say your public facing web server (e.g. nginx) or be
        applied as soon as it hits django.
        
        This ``cid`` is then available throught the django request/response cycle. We
        provide filters for logging witch adds the ``cid`` to the logging record so you
        can add it to your formatting string. We also provide wrappers around all the
        standard database backends which adds the ``cid`` as a comment before each SQL
        request.
