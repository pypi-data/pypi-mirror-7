<p>This is the core window of the application and is composed by four <em>panels</em>. On the left
there&#8217;s the <a class="reference internal" href="#competitors">competitors</a> one, where you can subscribe new players, retire existing ones or
rearrange them in teams if season&#8217;s <em class="guilabel">players per team</em> is bigger than 1 (first turn
only). On the right there&#8217;s the <a class="reference internal" href="#ranking">ranking</a> panel, where you can see the current ranking,
possibly grouped by nationality. At the bottom there&#8217;s the <a class="reference internal" href="#first-turn">first turn</a> view that let you
alter the random combination generated for the first turn. The remaining space in the middle is
dedicated to the <a class="reference internal" href="#matches">matches</a>.</p>
<p>The three panels on the borders can be minimized, thus maximizing the space for the
<a class="reference internal" href="#matches">matches</a>. In particular, the one on the left and the one at the bottom are mainly used only
just before and just after the first turn is created.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>General and federal rankings are basically summaries of a set of tourneys. Since they
are computed using the <strong>final prize</strong> of each competitor (possibly multiplied by the
tourney&#8217;s <em>prize factor</em>), obviously <strong>only</strong> <em>prized</em> tourneys are taken into
account.</p>
<p>This also means that if a tourney is being inserted &#8220;after the fact&#8221;, just to
introduce its scoring into the general rankings, details about single rounds may be
omitted. In this case follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>insert the list of competitors</li>
<li>confirm the changes</li>
<li>assign final prizes, with the <em class="guilabel">prize</em> button in the <a class="reference internal" href="#ranking">ranking</a> panel: this
will show the <em class="guilabel">final prize</em> column</li>
<li>manually change each competitor&#8217;s final prize, accordingly to the effective
tourney&#8217;s ranking</li>
<li>confirm the changes</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="competitors">
<h2>Competitors<a class="headerlink" href="#competitors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This panel is used mainly at the start of a new tourney, to compose the group of participating
players. Using <em>drag&amp;drop</em> you can either insert new players or rearrange them in teams, as
shown in the figure: you can drag single players from one team to another, or add new players
picking them from the <a class="reference internal" href="players.html#players-management"><em>players</em></a> window. The <em class="guilabel">add...</em> button
brings up that window, showing only players <strong>not yet</strong> associated with the tourney.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is possible to add new players at any time, even when the tournament has already
started and some matches has been played: even if this is not allowed in official
tourneys, in amateur events it may happen that a player is late, or that one person
of the public asks to enter the game. In such case, the new player gets zero points
and is positioned at the end of the current ranking.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-left figure">
<img alt="_images/competitors_2.png" src="_images/competitors_2.png" />
<p class="caption">Adjusted teams</p>
</div>
<p>You can see that there is a new completed team (with a green background); one team is not
complete because it has only one player: this has no effect on the succeding operations (it can
be played without problems) although it would be quite strange; another team will be deleted
(red background) because it&#8217;s only player has been removed.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p class="last">Players may be removed from the panel by dragging them and dropping over any empty
space (the scrollbar, when the panel is full): the icon associated to the drag
operation will reflect the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">It&#8217;s not possible to change the composition of a team once the first round has

<img alt="_images/retire.png" src="_images/retire.png" />
<p class="caption">Retire confirmation</p>
</div>
<p>A competitor may be retired by double-clicking it and confirming the action: this means that he
won&#8217;t participate to further games. He will show up in the ranking, though.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Teams</p>
<p>From the application point of view, the number of players that compose a single competitor
does <strong>not</strong> make any difference. Each game involves <em>two</em> distinct <em>competitors</em>, no matter
how many players are grouped in each one, each group represent a <em>single</em> entity.</p>
<p>When organizing a teamed championship, beware that any team is determined by the people
assigned to it <strong>and</strong> by their ordering: the team <cite>John and Paul</cite> is <strong>different</strong> from the
one composed by <cite>Paul and John</cite>, that is the same guys but in different order! This is where
the <cite>duplicate tourney</cite> action is very useful.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The <em class="guilabel">nationality</em> of a team is determined by that of its first player,
so order <em>matters</em>: be sure to drag in players in the right sequence.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="first-turn">
<h2>First turn<a class="headerlink" href="#first-turn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the subscription has been completed, the next step is to generate the first round of the
tournament, that will be done taking into account the current rate of each player if the
tourney is linked to a particular <a class="reference internal" href="ratings.html#glicko-rating-management"><em>rating</em></a>, otherwise by
coupling randomly the competitors.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>The <cite>arbiter</cite> may decide that the random combination generated by the application for the first
turn is not adeguate and some manual intervention is required. In this window, enabled <strong>only</strong>
before the first turn is actually played, you can drag&amp;drop competitors around, swapping them
as desired.</p>
<p>Even the association of matches with the carrom boards is random, for the first round. From the
second on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SoL</span></tt> tries to give a different board for each turn to a given player, following
ranking order. This guarantees that top players will preferably play on different low-numbered
boards, while weaker ones will use high-numbered boards, possibly repeatedly, in particular
when the number of players (and thus the number of tables) is very low.</p>

<div class="section" id="matches">
<h2>Matches<a class="headerlink" href="#matches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The middle panel is where most of the activity happens: here you iteratively create next turn,
insert its results and compute the new ranking.</p>
<p>Of course, only the <strong>last</strong> turn is editable, that is, you cannot alter previous rounds
results. If something went wrong and you need to rectify any previous score, you must <em>delete</em>
the last turn (or even more than one, should that make any sense at all), make the change and
regenerate the new turn.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>To insert the results of each round you may follow two distinct strategies:</p>
<ol class="last loweralpha simple">
<li>order the scorecards by board number and the insert the scores of each one: in
this case you can use the <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">TAB</span></tt> key that moves the <em>focus</em> to the next field;</li>
<li>when you have many boards (and thus the manual sort would be very tedious), you
can “jump” directly to the result of a particular board by simply entering the
board number: the <em>focus</em> will be moved to the right row and the score of the
first competitor will be activated for editing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whenever you change and commit the results of the last round the ranking is automatically
recomputed and shown here. The <em class="guilabel">prize</em> column is usually hidden until <em>prize giving</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p class="last">By double-clicking on a competitor the <a class="reference internal" href="#matches">matches</a> panel focuses on him showing only his
matches. You can see any other player details by double-clicking on another name. The
match panel returns to the usual view either by double-clicking the same player a
second time, or when a new turn is created.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the <em class="guilabel">Prize-giving</em> is done, the <em class="guilabel">prize</em> column becomes editable,
either to manually force the prizes, or to eventually swap top players after the final.</p>
