Description: ceilometer-publisher-vaultaire
        ==============================
        
        A publisher plugin for [Vaultaire].
        
        [Vaultaire]: https://github.com/anchor/vaultaire
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        This plugin queues samples and source dictionaries to a local [Marquise] spool.
        You will need [Pymarquise] and [libmarquise] installed as dependencies.
        
        [Marquise]: https://github.com/anchor/marquise
        [Pymarquise]: https://github.com/anchor/pymarquise
        [libmarquise]: https://github.com/anchor/libmarquise
        
        
        Installation
        ---
        
        
        Clone all the libraries into a location on the server
        
        Install marquise, and libmarquise as per their installation instructions
        
        run `(sudo) python setup.py install` for both pymarquise and ceilometer-publisher-vaultaire
        
        Confirm that the user running ceilometer can write to `/var/spool`. If not:
        
        ```
        mkdir /var/spool/marquise
        chown user:user /var/spool/marquise
        ```
        
        
        Once this is all setup, add the following to the sinks of choice into your `/etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml`
        
        ```
            publishers:
                - vaultaire://namespace
        ```
        
        Depending on your setup, you will need to restart:
        
        `ceilometer-anotification`
        `ceilometer-collector`
        `ceilometer-acompute`
