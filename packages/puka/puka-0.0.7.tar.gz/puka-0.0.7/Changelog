0.0.6
=====

 * Don't use 'immediate' flag for publishing when not using
   pubacks - due to RabbitMQ 3.0 changes.
 * Support for some unusual data types in tables:
   None, float (including nan and inf) and some unsigned integers.
 * #19 - some more tweaks for that.
 * Support 'client_properties' parameter in constructor,
   which can be used to pass data to the browser.
 * RabbitMQ way of handling user/pass problems changed -
   the connection is now dropped instead of sending
   a connection-close method.
 * #17 - some more puback / fake puback tests
 * #15 - on windows errno.ENOTCONN had different value
   than on linux / mac.
 * Set fcntl FD_CLOEXEC on puka sockets - we don't want child
   processes to get a copy of our descriptor.
 * #26 - basic support for AMQP heartbeats


0.0.5
=====

 * #15 - On windows, on slow network, client.wait may
   have failed with error 10057.


0.0.4
=====

 * Updated URL scheme parsing.
 * Better tests for pubacks.
 * Proper support for capabilities.
 * Support for canceling consumes (basic.cancel).

   of published messages unacked with pubacks enabled.
 * Many minor fixes.

   https://github.com/majek/puka/issues/3
