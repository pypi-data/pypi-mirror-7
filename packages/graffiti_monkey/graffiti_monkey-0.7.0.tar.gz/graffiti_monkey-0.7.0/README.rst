   :alt: Build Status

The Graffiti Monkey goes around tagging things. By looking at the tags an EC2
instance has, it copies those tags to the EBS Volumes that are attached to it,
and then copies those tags to the EBS Snapshots.

Usage
-----

::

	usage: graffiti-monkey [-h] [--region REGION] [--verbose] [--version]
	
	Propagates tags from AWS EC2 instances to EBS volumes, and then to EBS
	snapshots. This makes it much easier to find things down the road.
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
	  --region REGION  the region to tag things in (default is current region of
	                   EC2 instance this is running on). E.g. us-east-1
	  --verbose, -v    enable verbose output (-vvv for more)
	  --version        display version number and exit

Examples
--------

Suppose you have the following in `us-east-1`:

::

	i-abcd1234
	  - Tags:
	    - Name: "Instance 1"
	 
	vol-bcde3456
	  - Attached to i-abcd1234 on /dev/sda1
	 
	snap-cdef4567
	  - Snapshot of vol-bcde3456


When you run:

::

    graffiti-monkey --region us-east-1


First, Graffiti Monkey will set the EBS volume tags

::

	vol-bcde3456
	  - Tags:
	    - Name: "Instance 1"
	    - instance_id: i-abcd1234
	    - device: /dev/sda1
	    
and then it will set the tags on the EBS Snapshot

::

	snap-cdef4567
	  - Tags:
	    - Name: "Instance 1"
	    - instance_id: i-abcd1234
	    - device: /dev/sda1
