Description: Introduction
        ---------------
        
        WebGrid is a datagrid library for Flask and other Python web frameworks designed to work with
        SQLAlchemy ORM entities.
        
        Based on the configured grid, it will output an HTML table with sorting, filtering, and paging.
        
        It also will export the grid to Excel.
        
        For now, if you are interested in using it, you will need to see the source code and tests therein
        for example usage.
