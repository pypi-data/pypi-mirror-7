        KittyStore is the archiving library for `HyperKitty`_, the Mailman 3 archiver.
        It provides an interface to different storage systems. Currently only the
        `Storm ORM`_ system is supported.

        Populating the database
        =======================
        
        - Retrieve the archives by calling ``kittystore-download21``,
        - Load the archives by calling ``kittystore-import``.
        
        This might be memory intensive, so you may want to do 2 or 3 years per run and
        split the runs.
        
        Alternatively, to load the data you may want to do something like::
        
            for i in lists/devel-*; do kittystore-import -l devel@fp.o $i; done;
