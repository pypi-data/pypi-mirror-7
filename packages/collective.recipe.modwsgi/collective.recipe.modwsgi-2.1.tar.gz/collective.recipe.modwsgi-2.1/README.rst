Introduction
============

''collective.recipe.modwsgi'' is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe which creates
a `paste.deploy`_ entry point for mod_wsgi_.

It is very simple to use. This is a minimal ''buildout.cfg'' file
which creates a WSGI script mod_python can use::

    [buildout]
    parts = mywsgiapp

    [mywsgiapp]
    recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
    eggs = mywsgiapp
    config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini

This will create a small python script in parts/mywsgiapp called
''wsgi'' which mod_wsgi can load. You can also use the optional
''extra-paths'' option to specify extra paths that are added to
the python system path.

The apache configuration for this buildout looks like this::

    WSGIScriptAlias /mysite /home/me/buildout/parts/mywsgiapp/wsgi

    <Directory /home/me/buildout>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

If the python script must be accessed from somewhere else than the buildout
parts folder, you can use the optional ''target'' option to tell the recipe
where the script should be created.

For instance, the configuration for the mywsgiapp part could look like this::

    [mywsgiapp]
    recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
    eggs = mywsgiapp
    target = /var/www/myapp.wsgi
    config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini

The recipe would then create the script at /var/www/myapp.wsgi.

Note that the directory containing the target script must already exist on
the filesystem prior to running the recipe and be writeable.

The apache configuration for this buildout would then look like this::

    WSGIScriptAlias /mysite /var/www/myapp.wsgi

    <Directory /var/www>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

This recipe does not fully install packages, which means that console scripts
will not be created. If you need console scripts you can add a second
buildout part which uses `z3c.recipe.scripts`_ to do a full install.

Configuration files with multiple applications
----------------------------------------------

It is possible to specify multiple applications or pipelines in a single
configuration file. If you do this you can specify which application to
run by using the ``app_name`` option. For example if your ini files looks
like this::

    [app:my_app]
    use = egg:my_application

    [pipeline:production]
    pipeline = my_app
     
    [pipeline:devel]
    pipeline =
        egg:WebError#evalerror
    my_app

This specifies two way to run the your application: a *production*
configuration which runs the application directly, and a *devel*
configuration which also runs the WebError interactive debugger to
catch errors. To use the production pipeline in mod_wsgi supply
the app_name parameter::

    [mywsgiapp]
    recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
    eggs = mywsgiapp
    app_name = production
    config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini
