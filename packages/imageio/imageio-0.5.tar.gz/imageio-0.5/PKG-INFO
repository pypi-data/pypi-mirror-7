Description:  
        The imageio library aims to support reading and writing a wide 
        range of image data, including animated images, volumetric data, and
        scientific formats. It is written in pure Python (2.x and 3.x) and
        is designed to be powerful, yet simple in usage and installation.
        
        Imageio has a relatively simple core that provides a common interface
        to different file formats. The actual file formats are implemented in
        plugins, which makes imageio easy to extend. A large range of formats
        are already supported (in part thanks to the freeimage library), but
        we aim to include much more (scientific) formats in the future.
        
        Quickstart:
        
          * Use imageio.imread to read an image.
          * Use imageio.imsave to save an image.
          * See the `functions page <http://imageio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/functions.html>`_ for more information.
