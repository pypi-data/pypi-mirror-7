:mod:`weakref_property` -- Descriptor class implementing weakref properties.
============================================================================

Please, take a look at WeakProperty class' docstring.

__version__ = "0.1"



class WeakProperty(object):
    """Descriptor class implementing weakref properties.

    Add a property that acts like a normal attribute,
    but keeps a weak reference to anything that is assigned
    to it.

    First let's define WeakValue using WeakProperty
    and SomeClass that will be weakly referenced:

        >>> import weakref_property
        >>> import gc

        >>> class WeakValue(object):
        ...     value = weakref_property.WeakProperty('value')

        >>> class SomeClass(object):
        ...     pass

    You can assign and retrieve a value:

        >>> a = SomeClass()
        >>> obj = WeakValue()
        >>> obj.value = a
        >>> obj.value  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        <__main__.SomeClass object at ...>

    But it is kept as a weakref, so it can get collected.
    If it is collected, the property returns None.

        >>> del a
        >>> gc.collect()  # force gc to collect `a` object
        0
        >>> obj.value

    You can also delete the value completelly:

        >>> del obj.value
        >>> obj.value
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        AttributeError: 'WeakValue' object has no attribute 'value'

    Sadly, weakrefs do not work on list, dict, tuple and int:

        >>> obj.value = []
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'list' object
