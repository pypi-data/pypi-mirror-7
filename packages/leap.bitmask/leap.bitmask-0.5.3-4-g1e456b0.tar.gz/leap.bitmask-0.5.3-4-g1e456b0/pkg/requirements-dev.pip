# For temporary work, you can point this to your developer repo.
# consolidated changes will be pushed to pypi and then added
# to the main requirements.pip
#
# NOTE: you have to run pip install -r pkg/requirements.pip for pip
#       to install it. (do it after python setup.py develop and it
#       will only install this)
