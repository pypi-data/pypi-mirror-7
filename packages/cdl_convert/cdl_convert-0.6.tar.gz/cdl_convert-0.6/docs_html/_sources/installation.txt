Pip Install
===========

Using pip is the preferred method of installation, as it installs cdl_convert
both as a python module and a script.
::
    $ pip install cdl_convert

Script Only Installation
========================

If you don't want to bother with a pip style install, you can alternatively
grab `cdl_convert/cdl_convert.py`_, as this file is the script and all the
functions and classes needed.

You will need to place the python file somewhere (such as a ``bin`` folder),
and either run the script by directly invoking the file directly or creating
an alias to the file location.

Creating aliases, etc are beyond the scope of this documentation.
