Description: Navtrix - A Transform class.
        ====================================================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Navtrix tracks position and rotation in a Transform class.
        
        Status - In Development
        ------
        
        This is a helper library that mainly includes a Transform class.  Transform
        stores position as a vector and rotation as a Quaternion, and can output as
        a matrix for OpenGL.
        
        This will get more robust with more use.
