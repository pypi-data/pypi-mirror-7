PyCryptodome and PyCrypto
-------------------------

PyCryptodome is a recent fork of the `PyCrypto <https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto>`_ project.
At the time of the fork, the last official PyCrypto release was v2.6 but v2.7 was imminent.

PyCryptodome resides in the same namespace of PyCrypto (``Crypto``).
If your system includes a packaged version of PyCrypto, it is recommended you only install
PyCryptodome in a *virtualenv* environment.
