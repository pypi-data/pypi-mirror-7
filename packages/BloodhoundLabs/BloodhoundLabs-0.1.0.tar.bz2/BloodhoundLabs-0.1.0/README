== Installation ==

This plugin has been tested with

The first step to make it work is to [wiki:TracPlugins install this plugin] 
either for a particular environment or otherwise make it available to
all the environments:

{{{
$ easy_install /path/to/unpacked/BloodhoundLabs-x.y.z.zip
}}}

,, where ''x.y.z'' is the version of the plugin,,
