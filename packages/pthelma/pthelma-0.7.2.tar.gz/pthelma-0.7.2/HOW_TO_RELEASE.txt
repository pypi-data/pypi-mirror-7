The pthelma version has the form

    major.minor.micro


Here's how to release a new minor version X.Y.0:

    1. Update CHANGES.txt; changes showing on top as "dev" should now
       show as X.Y.0, with the current date. If no changes show, find
       them from the VCS and add them. Commit.

    2. Create a branch:

          git checkout -b X.Y

    3. In setup.py, in the definition of kwargs, change the value of
       version so that it has the value "X.Y.0" (should be "dev"
       before you change it).
       
    4. Likewise in loggertodb.iss, in the definition of MyAppVersion.

    5. Commit:

          git commit -a -m "Version X.Y.0"

    6. Create a tag:

          git tag X.Y.0

    7. In Windows, run

          python setup.py py2exe
       
       then open Inno Setup and compile.

    8. Push the new branch and the new tag:

          git push origin X.Y
          git push origin X.Y.0

    9. Create a new release in github.

   10. Upload Inno Setup's output file, loggertodb-X.Y.0-setup.exe,
       to the github release page.

   11. Upload to pypi:
    
          ./setup.py sdist upload


Here's how to release a new micro X.Y.Z version:

    1. Switch to the X.Y branch:

          git checkout X.Y

    2. Make the required bug fixes and commit them.

    3. In setup.py, in the definition of kwargs, change the value of
       version so that it has the value "X.Y.Z" (should be "X.Y.Q"
       where Q=Z-1).

    4. Likewise in loggertodb.iss, in the definition of MyAppVersion.

    5. Update CHANGES.txt.

          git push
          git push origin X.Y.Z

   10. Create a new release in github.
