Description: 
        PyGaia
        ======
        
        **Python toolkit for basic Gaia data simulation, manipulation, and analysis**
        
        PyGaia provides python modules for the simulation of Gaia data and their errors,
        as well modules for the manipulation and analysis of the Gaia catalogue data. In
        particular transformations between astrometric observables and phase space
        variables are provided as well as transformations between sky coordinate
        systems. Only (very) basic functionality is provided. Full blown simulations of
        Gaia data in all their gory detail requires the Java tools developed by the Gaia
        Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) in particular its Coordination
        Unit 2 (CU2).
        
        This toolkit is basically an implementation of the performance models for Gaia
        which are publicly available at:
        `<http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=GAIA&page=Science_Performance>`_. In
        addition much of the material in chapter 4 of the book `Astrometry for
        Astrophysics: Methods, Models, and Applications (2012, van Altena et al.)
        <http://www.cambridge.org/9780521519205>`_ is implemented.
        
        Note that the code in this package is *not intended for accurate astrometry
        applications*, such as predicting in detail astrometric paths of stars on the
        sky, or transforming between observation epochs.
        
        THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE CODE (0.6) CALCULATES THE PRE-LAUNCH PERFORMANCE
        PREDICTIONS FOR GAIA. AS OF 2014-07-18 THE PERFORMANCE NUMBERS ARE UNDER REVISION
        FOLLOWING THE GAIA COMMISSIONING PERIOD. THE PYGAIA CODE WILL BE UPDATED
        ACCORDINGLY TOWARD THE END OF AUGUST 2014.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        All classes and methods/functions are documented so use the python help()
        function to find out more. More extensive documentation will follow.
        
        Installation notes
        ------------------
        
        This package was developed in a python 2.7 environment and you may experience
        problems if you have an older version installed. In particular the scripts in
        the *examples* folder will not run because they expect the argparse module to be
        present.
        
        The following python packages are required:
        
        * `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
        * `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
        
        For the plotting tools:
        
        * `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
        * `Basemap toolkit for matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`_
