Description: 
        Karta - tidy Python package for geospatial computation
        ======================================================
        
        *Karta* is a Leatherman for geographic analyses. *Karta* provides an interface
        for solving problems in Python/Python3 that works nicely with existing packages.
        It provides simple and clean vector and raster data types, a small selection of
        analysis functions, and the ability to read and write several useful formats.
        
        Goals of *Karta* include providing a simple, lightweight, and fast set of tools
        useful for everyday spatial analysis, as well as a flexible set of abstractions
        upon which to build more advanced routines. *Karta* should be considered a work
        in progress.
        
        ##CONTENTS AT A GLANCE
        
        - vector
            - guppy:        Vector geometry classes (e.g. `Point`, `Multipoint`, `Line`, `Polygon`)
            - gpx:          GPX class for parsing and constructing GPX eXchange files
            - geojson:      Classes and functions for reading and writing GeoJSON
            - vtk:          XML-based VTK interface
            - shp\_funcs:   Shapefile-to-guppy conversions through _pyshp_ interface
            - stats:        Basic geostatistical functions
            - xyfile:       ASCII table functions
        
        - raster
            - grid:         Basic Grid types, including `StructuredGrid` and `RegularGrid`
            - raster:       General purpose raster functions
            - aaigrid:      Grid subclass specifically for reading, writing, and manipulating ESRI ASCII grids
            - flow:         Stream flow functions
            - streamline:   Streamline calculation
        
        - tests : unit tests
        
        
        ##FORMATS
        
        *Karta* provides a basic working interface to several of common file formats.
        Currently partially-supported are:
        
        - vector
            - ASCII tables (XYZ) (r,w)
            - GeoJSON (r,w)
            - GPS eXchange (GPX) (r,w)
            - VTK (w)
            - ESRI Shapefiles via pyshp (r,w)
        - raster
            - ESRI ASCII Grid (r,w)
            - USGS DEM (WIP)
        
        ## INSTALLATION
        
        The easiest way to install is to use `pip`.
        
            cd karta/
            pip install .
        
        ## DEPENDENCIES
        
        ### Required
        
        - Python 2.7+ or Python 3.2+
        - numpy
        - pyshp
        - pyproj (required for geodetic calculations)
        
        ### Optional
        
        - cython
        - scipy
        
        Cython is an optional dependency used to speed up select functions. In general,
        enhanced-performance functions will then be called automatically when available,
        otherwise *Karta* will fall back to numpy and pure-Python versions.
        
        When installing from PyPI, C source code is provided and will be automatically
        compiled if a suitable compiler is available.
        
        ## TESTING
        
        To run all unit tests, execute
        
            python tests/runtests.py
