Nereid Test Module
==================

This module is an optional tryton module which helps in testing nereid
features. This module is not required for the regular functioning of
nereid but if you are developing on nereid, you could use this module to
write tests.

History
-------

This module was originally a part of nereid itself and then moved out as
nereid is to be a part of tryton. This module can be added to the
test_requires list of your module if you use it in testing.
