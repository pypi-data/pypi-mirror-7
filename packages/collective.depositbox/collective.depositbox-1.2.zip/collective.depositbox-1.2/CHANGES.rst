Changelog
=========

1.2 (2014-08-04)
----------------

- Add locales, with Dutch translations.
  [maurits]

- Add simple ``deposit-box-data`` view to see confirmed data.  You may
  want to override this in your own code with some view that presents
  it in a nicer way because it knows what kind of values are stored.
  [maurits]

- Add permission ``collective.depositbox: View Data``.  Allow access
  to ``get_all_confirmed`` data when the user has this permission.
  We do not grant the permission explicitly, so by default only a
  Manager has it.
