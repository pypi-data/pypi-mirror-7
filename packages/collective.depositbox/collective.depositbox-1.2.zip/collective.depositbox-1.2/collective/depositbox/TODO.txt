* May want to allow more than one box per context.  Use named adapters?
  Add self.boxname in the BaseView.  The BoxAdapter may then need to
  store a persistent dict/mapping of Boxes.  And/or make a
  MultiBoxAdapter?  But integrators can also register their own simple
  adapter, inheriting from our BoxAdapter and using a different
  ANNO_KEY.
