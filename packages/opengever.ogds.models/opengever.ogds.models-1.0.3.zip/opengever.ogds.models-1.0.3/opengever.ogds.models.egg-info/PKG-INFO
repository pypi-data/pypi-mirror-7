Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains the SQLAlchemy models for the OpenGever directory
        service.
        
        The purpose of making `opengever.ogds.models` its own package is to allow
        other appliactions than OpenGever to use its models, for example the so called
        "bridge" (a small Pyramid application).
        
        Therefore `opengever.ogds.models` should not have any Plone dependencies (except
        for testing, using the `[tests]` extra), but instead only depend on SQLAlchemy
        and possibly other pure Python libraries.
