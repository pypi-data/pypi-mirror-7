Description: # Salesforce Oauth Request
        
        A bit of Requests driven utility code to drive the Salesforce.com Oauth2 Web flow. Use this module to login to a Salesforce account using just the username and password. Good for tests and scripts which need
        Salesforce access_token access.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```pip install salesforce-oauth-request```
        
        ## Usage
        
        You need a Connected App defined in Salesforce so that you have all these pieces of info:
        
        1. `client ID`
        2. `client secret`
        3. `redirect uri`
        
        Now you can get an `access_token` and `instance_url` like this:
        
        ```
        import salesforce_oauth_request
        
        result = salesforce_oauth_request.login(username=username,
        										password=password,
        										client_id=client_id,
        										client_secret=client_secret,
        										redirect_uri=redirect_uri)
        
        print "Access token:  %s" + result['access_token']
        print "Refresh token: %s" + result['refresh_token']
        print "Instance URL:  %s" + result['instance_url']
        
        # Now use access_token, instance_url for REST, SOAP, or BULK API access.
        ```
        ## Options
        
        ```
        cache_session=True/False - default False
        ```
        
        Pass the option `cache_session=true` to save the access token to `~.sf_oauth`
        to save time on repeated runs.
        
        ```
        sandbox=True/False - default False
        ```
        
        Pass `sandbox=True` to use a sandbox login.
        ## Testing
        
        You can run the simple test script like this:
        
        ```python test.py```
        
        It will prompt you for all the values, drive the login, and print the results.
