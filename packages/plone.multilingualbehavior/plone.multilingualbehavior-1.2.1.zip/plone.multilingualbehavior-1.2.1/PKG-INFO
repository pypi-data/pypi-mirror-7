Description: ============================
        plone.multilingualbehavior
        ============================
        
        plone.multilingualbehavior adds multilingual behavior to content types built
        with Dexterity. It uses the next generation multilingual engine powered by
        five/Zope3 technologies, plone.multilingual.
        
        The behavior provides the Dexterity-driven content with a marker interface
        "ITranslatable", and makes available to that translation enabled type all the
        translation UI components such as menus, views, etc...
        
        To make your Dexterity content type translatable, add the following line to
        the <!-- enabled behaviors --> section in your type's profile::
        
            <!-- enabled behaviors -->
            <property name="behaviors">
                <element value="plone.multilingualbehavior.interfaces.IDexterityTranslatable" />
            </property>
        
        plone.multilingualbehavior implements language independent fields. The content
        of language independent fields is the same across all language versions. This
        is convenient, but also a little dangerous, because editing the field on any
        language version will change the content on all other language versions.
        
        For details on how to make fields language independent, see the examples in
        the test folder. tests/schemata.py shows how to make fields language
        independent when using the Grok framework; tests/samplecontent_type.xml shows
        how to achieve the same thing in an xml file. It is also possible to set a
        field to be language independent through the web, given a sufficiently new
        version of plone.schemaeditor.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2.1 (2014-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Use the more specific IEditFinishedEvent rather than IObjectModifiedEvent
          for copying over language independent fields, since IObjectModifiedEvent
          can be thrown multiple times, causing a performace lag [pysailor]
        
        1.2 - 2013-09-24
        ----------------
        
        - Check property ``bypass_languageindependent_field_permission_check`` exists
          in registry to allow usage with lrf-branch.  [saily]
        
        - Rewrite ``handle_modified`` subscriber to notify ObjectModifiedEvent,
          and pass canonical object as event-description. This replaces the non-working
          semaphore.  Fixes #65
          [saily]
        
        - Switch to a cloned user with a global Editor role to allow synchronization
          of language independant fields of other object (which the current user could
          not have permission to) when modifying an object.  Fixes #66
          [saily]
        
        - We may need to know the language from a object that is not ITranslatable
          [ramon]

        ----------------
        
        - Removing ITG usage to ITranslationManager
          [pysailor]
        - Added a test for adding multilingual behavior through the web
          [pysailor]
        
        
        1.0rc1 - 2013-01-26

          [ramon]
        
        - PEP8 cleanup
          [saily]
        
        - Correct import and add new dependency for ``plone.supermodel.model``
          because ``plone.directives.form`` 2.0 does no longer depend on grok.
          [saily]
