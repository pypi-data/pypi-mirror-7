        CollateX is a software to
        
        - read multiple (â‰¥ 2) versions of a text, splitting each version into parts (tokens) to be compared,
        - identify similarities of and differences between the versions (including moved/transposed segments) by aligning tokens, and
        - output the alignment results in a variety of formats for further processing, for instance to support the production of a critical apparatus or the stemmatical analysis of a text's genesis.

        * Documentation: http://collatex.rtfd.org.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * non progressive multiple sequence alignment
        * multiple output formats: alignment table, variant graph
        
        How to install:
        ---------------
        
        Mac/Linux:
        sudo pip install --pre collatex
        
        if you don't have pip installed, install it first with:
        sudo easy_install pip
        
        Simple example:
        ---------------
        ::
        
          from collatex import *
        
          collation = Collation()
          collation.add_witness("A", "The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.")
          collation.add_witness("B", "The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
        
          alignment_table = collate(collation)
          print(alignment_table)
        
        When using IPython Notebook a nice HTML representation of the alignment table is shown when the collate function is called.
        Output can also be shown as a graph instead of a table when graphviz and pygraphviz are installed:
        ::
        
          collate(collation, output="graph")

        2.0.0pre3 (2014-06-10)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fixed imports in init.py, "from collatex import *" now works correctly.
        * Added IPython HTML support for alignment table.
        * Added IPython SVG support for variant graph.
        * Added convenience constructors on Collation object. 
        * Added horizontal layout for the alignment table visualization, next to vertical one.
        
        2.0.0pre2 (2014-06-09)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Removed max 6 witness limit in aligner, now n number of witnesses can be aligned. 
        * Added transposition detection.
        * Added alignment table plus plain text visualization.
        * Added collate convenience function.
        
        2.0.0pre1 (2014-06-02)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * First release on PyPI.
        * First pure Python development release of CollateX.
        * New collation algorithm, which does non progressive multiple witness alignment.
