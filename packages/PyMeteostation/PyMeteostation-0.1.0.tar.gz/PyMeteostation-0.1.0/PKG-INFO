Description: ==============
        PyMeteostation
        ==============
        
        Pymeteostation is software made for controlling meteostation built of MLAB electronic modules (http://www.mlab.cz/) and sending measurements to Open Weather Map (http://openweathermap.org/).
        
        Currently supported sensors are:
        
        * SHT25v01A (Sensirion SHT25)
        * ALTIMET01A (MPL3115A2)
        
        Software dependencies
        =====================
        
        * Pymlab (>= 0.2, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymlab/)
        
        How to
        ======
        
        1. Install PyMeteostation::
            
            pip install PyMeteostation
        
        2. Create an account on http://openweathermap.org/
        
        3. Run::
        
            pymeteostation -g
        
           This wil generate basic configuration file named .pymeteostation in your home directory.
        
        4. Fill the generated config file:
        
           * *[Meteostation]* section:
        
             Requiered options: *username*, *password*, *uploadinterval* (in seconds) and *logpath* (must be absolute path)
        
             If you use ALTIMET01A sensor you must fill *altitude* option too. (It is used for correcting pressure to sea level altitude.)
        
           * *[I2C_Device]* section:
        
             Enter I2C configuration. (example options: *type*, *name*, *address*, *channel*, *children*...)
        
             Usage of *children* option::
        
                 children = sensor1;sensor2;
        
             The names in *children* option are names of sections defining the children devices.
        
             Sensors must have *name* option filled.
        
             Currently supported device types: *i2chub*, *sht25*, *altimet01*
        
           * *[Translation_Into_POST]* section:
             
             Into option, which you want to send, fill sensor name, from which will be gathered data, and sensor measurement ID (this is because some sensors return more than one measurement).
        
           **Example**::
          
               [Meteostation]
               username = user
               password = XXXXXX
               uploadinterval = 120
               logpath = /home/user/PyMeteostation-logs/
               stationname = Meteostation 01
               latitude = 0.0
               longtitude = 0.0
               altitude = 0.0
        
               [I2C_Device]
               type = i2chub
               address = 0x72
               children = barometer;hum_temp;
        
               [barometer]
               name = barometer
               type = altimet01
               channel = 0
        
               [hum_temp]
               name = hum_temp
               type = sht25
               channel = 1
        
               [Translation_Into_POST]
               wind_dir = 
               wind_speed = 
               wind_gust = 
               temp = hum_temp;1;
               humidity = hum_temp;0;
               pressure = barometer;1;
               rain_1h = 
               rain_24h = 
               rain_today = 
               snow = 
               lum = 
               radiation = 
               dew_point = 
               uv = 
        
        5. (optional) I recommend to run::
        
               pymetostation -n
        
           This will run PyMeteostation not as service, so you can check if are there any errors.
        
        6. Run::
        
               pymeteostation start|stop|restart
        
           This will start PyMeteostation as service.
