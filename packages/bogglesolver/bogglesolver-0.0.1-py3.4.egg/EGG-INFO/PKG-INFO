Description: BoggleSolver
        ============
        
        Create a dictionary and then eventually solve for all words on a boggle board
        
        # Dependencies
        You have python installed.
        
        # Current Install Process
        Boggle is now command line functional. To install, run 'python setup.py install'. 
        
        Once you do this, my app at: https://github.com/theovoss/Kivy_boggle will run with `python boggle.py`
        
        # Game Play
        To play a game, run 'bogglesolver -p'. This will auto-generate a board, display it, and then wait for user input. When you press 'enter', it will display all the valid words for that board. 
        
        Currently there is no time limit, though that will be added fairly soon as an optional addition.
        
        The dictionary used is the twl06 dictionary which is the official tournament and club word list. I added one word ("theo") to the dictionary for fun. :)
