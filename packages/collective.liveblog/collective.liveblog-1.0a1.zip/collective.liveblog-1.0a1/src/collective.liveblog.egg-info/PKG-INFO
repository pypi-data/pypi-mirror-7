        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ==================================
        
        A liveblog is a blog post which is intended to provide a rolling textual coverage of an ongoing event.
        
        A liveblog is continuously updated with timestamped micro-updates which are placed above previous micro-updates.
        
        Typical use case is the following:
        
        - the publisher of a news site creates a liveblog
        - editors add micro-updates to the liveblog as the event goes on
        - visitors of the liveblog get micro-updates automatically via AJAX calls
        
        Mostly Harmless

        Todo list
        ---------
        
        - Do not load all micro-updates by default as the page could grow huge
        - Implement infinite scrolling
        - Prettify the prepend of micro-updates
        - Use fuzzy dates

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.liveblog
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.liveblog`` and click the 'Activate' button.
