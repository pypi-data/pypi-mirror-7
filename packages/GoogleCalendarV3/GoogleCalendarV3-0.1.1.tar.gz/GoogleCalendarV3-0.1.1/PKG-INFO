Description: ===================
        Google Calendar V3
        ===================
        
        Google Calendar V3 provides an API client that can be authenticated
        using the following:
            access_token, refresh_token, client_id, and client_secret
        
        Once authenticated you can easily call any of the methods for the
        various resources associated with the API.
        
        Each instance method of the GoogleCalendarAPI is a method for a resource.
        Required parameters are enforced by the function header and any additional
        query parameters arguments or the body data must be constructed and passed
        in as kwargs or as body respectively.
