Changelog
=========
* 0.3.5
    * Not all docx files contain a `styles.xml` file. We are no longer assuming
      they do.
* 0.3.4
    * It is possible for `w:t` tags to have `text` set to `None`. This no longer causes an error when escaping that text.
* 0.3.3
    * In the event that `cElementTree` has a problem parsing the document, a
      `MalformedDocxException` is raised instead of a `SyntaxError`
* 0.3.2
    * We were not taking into account that vertical merges should have a
      continue attribute, but sometimes they do not, and in those cases word
      assumes the continue attribute. We updated the parser to handle the
      cases in which the continue attribute is not there.
    * We now correctly handle documents with unicode character in the
      namespace.
    * In rare cases, some text would be output with a style when it should not
      have been. This issue has been fixed.
* 0.3.1
    * Added support for several more OOXML tags including:
        * caps
        * smallCaps
        * strike
        * dstrike
        * vanish
        * webHidden
      More details in the README.
* 0.3.0
    * We switched from using stock *xml.etree.ElementTree* to using
      *xml.etree.cElementTree*. This has resulted in a fairly significant speed
      increase for python 2.6
    * It is now possible to create your own pre processor to do additional pre
      processing.
    * Superscripts and subscripts are now extracted correctly.
* 0.2.1
    * Added a changelog
    * Added the version in pydocx.__init__
    * Fixed an issue with duplicating content if there was indentation or
      justification on a p element that had multiple t tags.
