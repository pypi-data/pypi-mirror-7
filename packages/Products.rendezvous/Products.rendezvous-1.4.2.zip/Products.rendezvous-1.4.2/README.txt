Introduction
============

Products.rendezvous is a doodle-like timeboard to select a rendez-vous when most people
are available.

You create a RendezVous content type where you select some days.
For each date, you create 0 to several slots
(for instance: 1pm, 2pm, morning, evening)
and you publish your object.

Then you send the url to all people you want to see at this rendezvous.
Each member of the portal can participate to this rendezvous.
The user checks the days and slots which for he or she is available.
