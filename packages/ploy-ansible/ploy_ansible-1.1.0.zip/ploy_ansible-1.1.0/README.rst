Overview
========

The ploy_ansible plugin provides integration of `Ansible`_ with `ploy`_.
It automatically builds an `inventory`_ and provides a custom connection plugin.

Installation
============

ploy_ansible is best installed with easy_install, pip or with zc.recipe.egg in a buildout.


Commands
========

The plugin adds the following commands to ploy.

``configure``
  Configures an instance.
  There are three ways to specify how to configure an instance.
  Applying the roles given by the ``roles`` option of an instance, a playbook set by the ``playbook`` option or a playbook with the unique name of the instance found in the ``playbooks-directory``.
  Using ``roles`` or a playbook is mutually exclusive.
  If you specify a playbook and there is also a playbook in the default location, you will get a warning.

``ansible``
  Runs an Ansible command.
  This basically reflects the ``ansible`` script of Ansible.

``playbook``
  Applies a playbook.
  This basically reflects the ``ansible-playbook`` script of Ansible.


Options
=======

Global
------

The ``playbooks-directory`` option of the ``ansible`` section allows you to specify the directory where playbooks, roles, host_vars etc are looked up.
If you specify a relative path, then it's always relative to the ``ploy.conf`` directory.
If you have a structure like this::

    project
    |-- deployment
    | |-- roles
    | |-- host_vars
    |
    |-- etc
      |-- ploy.conf

Then you would put the following into your ``ploy.conf``::

    [ansible]
    playbooks-directory = ../deployment

By default it is set to the parent directory of the directory the ``ploy.conf`` is located at like this::

    project
    |-- roles
    |-- host_vars
    |-- etc
      |-- ploy.conf


Per instance
------------

``roles``
  Used by the ``configure`` command.
  This allows you to configure an instance by applying the whitespace separated roles.
  This is like creating a playbook which only specifies a host and a list of roles names.

``playbook``
  Allows you to explicitly specify a playbook to use for this instance.

Any option starting with ``ansible_`` is passed through to Ansible as is. This can be used for settings like ``ansible_python_interpreter``.

Any option starting with ``ansible-`` is stripped of the ``ansible-`` prefix and then passed through to Ansible.
This is the main way to set Ansible variables for use in playbooks and roles.

All other options are prefixed with ``ploy_`` and made available to Ansible.


Ansible inventory
=================

All instances in ``ploy.conf`` are available to Ansible via their **unique id**.

The variables for each instance are gathered from ``group_vars``, ``host_vars`` and the ``ploy.conf``.


API usage
=========

On the Python side, each ploy instance gains the following methods:

``apply_playbook(self, playbook, *args, **kwargs)``
  Applies the ``playbook`` to the instance.

``has_playbook``
  Return ``True`` if the instance has either of the ``roles`` or a playbook option set.

``get_playbook(*args, **kwargs)``
  Returns an instance of the Ansible internal ``PlayBook`` class.
  This is either from a file (from ``playbook`` option or the playbook kwarg), or dynamically generated from the ``roles`` option.

``configure(*args, **kwargs)``
  Configures the instance with the same semantics as the ``configure`` command.

``get_ansible_variables``
  Returns the Ansible variables from the inventory.
  This does not include *facts*, as it doesn't connect to the instance.
  This is particularly useful in Fabric scripts.

  [fschulze]


1.0b5 - 2014-06-16
------------------

* Set user in playbook to the one from the config if it's not set already.
  [fschulze]

* Change default playbook directory from the aws.conf directory to it's parent.
  [fschulze]


1.0b4 - 2014-06-11
------------------

* Added ``playbook`` and ``roles`` config options for instances.
  [fschulze]

* Added ``has_playbook`` and ``configure`` methods to instances.
  [fschulze]

* Added before/after_ansible_configure hooks.
  [fschulze]


1.0b3 - 2014-06-09
------------------

* Use execnet for connections. There is only one ssh connection per host and
  it's reused for all commands.
  [fschulze]

* Make sure the playbook directory is always absolute.
  [fschulze]

* Prevent use of persistent ssh connections, as that easily results in
  connections to wrong jails because of the proxying. This makes ansible a lot
  slower at the moment.
  [fschulze]

* Add support for su and vault (ansible 1.5) as well as ``--force-handlers``
  (ansible 1.6).
  [fschulze]

* Removed ``ansible`` from install requirements. It won't install in a buildout
  so it needs to be installed in a virtualenv or via a system package.
  [fschulze]


1.0b2 - 2014-05-15
------------------

* Add ``configure`` command which is a stripped down variant of the
  ``playbook`` command with assumptions about the location of the yml file.
  [fschulze]

* Warn if a playbook is requested for a host that is not configured in the
  playbook hosts list.
  [fschulze]

* Allow mr.awsome plugins to add ansible variables.
  [fschulze]

* Inject the ansible paths sooner as they may not apply in some cases otherwise.
  [fschulze]

* Moved setuptools-git from setup.py to .travis.yml, it's only needed for
  releases and testing.
  [fschulze]


1.0b1 - 2014-03-24
------------------

* Initial release
