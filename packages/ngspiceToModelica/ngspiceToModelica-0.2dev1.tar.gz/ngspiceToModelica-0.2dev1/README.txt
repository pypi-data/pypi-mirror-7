Ngspice to Modelica Converter
------------------------------

Author: Rakhi R, IIT Bombay, India, 2014

This project converts an ngspice netlist to Modelica code. It can handle device models for diode and MOSFETs, and subcircuits. Currently BJTs, JFETs are not supported. Xspice is also not currently supported.

For MOSFET based Modelica models, BondLib3 library for Modelica 3 is required.
