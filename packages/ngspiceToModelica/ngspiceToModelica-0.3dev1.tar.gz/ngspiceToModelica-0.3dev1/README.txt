Ngspice to Modelica Converter
------------------------------

Author: Rakhi R, IIT Bombay, India, 2014

This project converts an ngspice netlist to Modelica code. It can handle device models for diode, BJTs and MOSFETs, and subcircuits. Xspice is not currently supported.

For MOSFET based Modelica models, BondLib3 library for Modelica 3 is required.
