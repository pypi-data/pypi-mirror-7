        About
        =====
        
        ``OutputCheck`` is a tool for checking the output of console programs
        that is inspired by the FileCheck tool used by LLVM. It has its own
        small language for describing the expected output of a tool that
        is considerably more convenient and more powerful than GNU ``grep``.
