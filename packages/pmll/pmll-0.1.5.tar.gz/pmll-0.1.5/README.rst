Pmll is MIT Licensed machine learning library, it is written in Python. Most of existing libraries cover specific part of machine learning (svm solvers, neural networks) or collect range of algorithms, sometimes with visualization tools. Purpuse of pmll is to bring structure and make machine learning easy. It has module structure and it is easy to extend the library. Pmll ispired by R, MATLAB and orange.
