        Eventlet WSGI Server
        ====================
        
        The purpose of this repository is to provide for a general purpose eventlet
        server that can power just about any Application. It is my hope that is
        used to rapidly spin up a WSGI server which has support for many common
        configurations while also being performant enough to server your content 
        without having to setup a more heavy weight web server.
        
        This is a great tool for embedded applications where Apache and or NGINX may
        not be an option.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use ewsgi simply build your application and then pass the application and
        the relevant configuration to the server. Everything else is handled from
        there on in.
        
        For an example on how an app could look like please go here: 
        https://github.com/cloudnull/eventlet_wsgi/tree/master/example_app
        
        
        However, if you would like to know how to make the server work, minimally, 
        you can simply instantiate the server and run it:
        
        .. code-block:: bash 
        
            # Assuming you have a built app import it and pass it to eswgi
            from ewsgi import run
        
            # This import would be your app
            import app
        
            # Run the new application with all of the relevant configuration bits
            run.preload_and_start(
                app_name=app.APPNAME,    # Name of your app
                load_app=app.APP,        # The prebuilt app object
                config_path=os.getcwd(), # The path to your configuration files
                loggers=[app.APPNAME]    # List of log handlers for the app
            )
