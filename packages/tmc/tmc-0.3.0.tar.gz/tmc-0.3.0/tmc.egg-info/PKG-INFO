Description: tmc.py
        ======
        
        This is a complete redo of tmc.py targeting exclusively Python3. It's not usable
        yet, but it tries to have a little bit nicer structure.
        
        note
        ----
        
        The legacy branch has the python2 version. It's the version also in [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tmc/0.2.2)

        in that folder.
        
        ### tmc reset
        
        Reset the database.

                tmc run subl3 && tmc test && tmc submit && tmc next
