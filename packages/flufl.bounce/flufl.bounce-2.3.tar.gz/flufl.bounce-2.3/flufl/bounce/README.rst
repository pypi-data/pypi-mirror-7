flufl.bounce - Email bounce detectors.
======================================

The ``flufl.bounce`` library provides a set of heuristics and an API for
detecting the original bouncing email addresses from a bounce message.  Many
formats found in the wild are supported, as are VERP_ and RFC 3464 (DSN_).
