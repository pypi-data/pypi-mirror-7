"""Netscape Messaging Server bounce formats.

I've seen at least one NMS server version 3.6 (envy.gmp.usyd.edu.au) bounce
messages of this format.  Bounces come in DSN MIME format, but don't include
any -Recipient: headers.  Gotta just parse the text :(

NMS 4.1 (dfw-smtpin1.email.verio.net) seems even worse, but we'll try to
decipher the format here too.
