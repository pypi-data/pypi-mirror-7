           Email bounce detectors.
           
           The ``flufl.bounce`` library provides a set of heuristics and an API for
           detecting the original bouncing email addresses from a bounce message.  Many
           formats found in the wild are supported, as are VERP_ and RFC 3464 (DSN_).

           NEWS for flufl.bounce
           =====================
           
           2.3 (2014-08-18)
           ================
            * Added recognition for a kundenserver.de warning to simplewarning.py.
              (LP: #1263247)
            * Stop using the deprecated `distribute` package in favor of the now-merged
              `setuptools` package.
            * Stop using the deprecated `flufl.enum` package in favor of the enum34
              package (for Python 2) or built-in enum package (for Python 3).
           
           
           2.2.1 (2013-06-21)
           ==================
            * Prune some artifacts unintentionally leaked into the release tarball.
           
           
           2.2 (2013-06-20)
           ================
            * Added recognition for a bogus Dovecot over-quota rejection sent as an MDN
              rather than a DSN.  (LP: #693134)
            * Tweaked a simplematch regexp that didn't always work.  (LP: #1079254)
            * Added recognition for bounces from mail.ru.  Thanks to Andrey
              Rahmatullin.  (LP: #1079249)
            * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError in qmail.py with non-ascii message.  Thanks
              to Theo Spears.  (LP: #1074592)
            * Added recognition for another Yahoo bounce format.  Thanks to Mark
              Sapiro. (LP: #1157961)
            * Fix documentation bug.  (LP: #1026403)
            * Document the zope.interface requirement. (LP: #1021383)
           
           
           2.1.1 (2012-04-19)
           ==================
            * Add classifiers to setup.py and make the long description more compatible
              with the Cheeseshop.
            * Other changes to make the Cheeseshop page look nicer.  (LP: #680136)
            * setup_helper.py version 2.1.
           
           
           2.1 (2012-01-19)
           ================
            * Fix TypeError thrown when None is returned by Caiwireless.  Given by Paul
              Egan. (LP: #917720)
           
           
           2.0 (2012-01-04)
           ================
            * Port to Python 3 without the use of `2to3`.  Switch to class decorator
              syntax for declaring that a class implements an interface.  The functional
              form doesn't work for Python 3.
            * All returned addresses are bytes objects in Python 3 and 8-bit strings in
              Python 2 (no change there).
            * Add an additional in-the-wild example of a qmail bounce.  Given by Mark
              Sapiro.
            * Export `all_failures` in the package's namespace.
            * Fix `python setup.py test` so that it runs all the tests exactly once.
              There seems to be no portable way to support that and unittest discovery
              (i.e. `python -m unittest discover`) and since the latter requires
              virtualenv, just disable it for now.  (LP: #911399)
            * Add full copy of LGPLv3 to source tarball. (LP: #871961)
           
           
           1.0.2 (2011-10-10)
           ==================
            * Fixed MANIFEST.in to exclude the .egg.
           
           
           1.0.1 (2011-10-07)
           ==================
            * Fixed licenses.  All code is LGPLv3.
           
           
           1.0 (2011-08-22)
           ================
            * Initial release.
           
           
           0.91 (2011-07-15)
           =================
            * Provide a nicer interface for detector modules.  Instead of using the magic
              empty tuple returns, provide three convenience constants in the interfaces
              module: NoFailures, NoTemporaryFailures, and NoPermanentFailures.
            * Add logging support.  Applications can initialize the `flufl.bounce`
              logger.  The test suite does its own logging.basicConfig(), which can be
              influenced by the environment variable $FLUFL_LOGGING.  See
              flufl/bounce/tests/helpers.py for details.
           
           
           0.90 (2011-07-02)
           =================
            * Initial refactoring from Mailman 3.
