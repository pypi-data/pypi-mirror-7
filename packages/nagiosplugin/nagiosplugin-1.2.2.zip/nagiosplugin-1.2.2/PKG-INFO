Description: The nagiosplugin library
        ========================
        
        About
        -----
        
        **nagiosplugin** is a Python class library which helps writing Nagios (or Icinga)
        compatible plugins easily in Python. It cares for much of the boilerplate code
        and default logic commonly found in Nagios checks, including:
        
        - Nagios 3 Plugin API compliant parameters and output formatting
        - Full Nagios range syntax support
        - Automatic threshold checking
        - Multiple independend measures
        - Custom status line to communicate the main point quickly
        - Long output and performance data
        - Timeout handling
        - Persistent "cookies" to retain state information between check runs
        - Resume log file processing at the point where the last run left
        - No dependencies beyond the Python standard library (except for Python 2.6).
        
        nagiosplugin runs on POSIX and Windows systems. It is compatible with Python
        3.4, Python 3.3, Python 3.2, Python 2.7, and Python 2.6.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Comprehensive documentation is `available online`_. The examples mentioned in
        the `tutorials`_ can also be found in the `nagiosplugin/examples` directory of
        the source distribution.

        Development
        ===========
        
        Getting the source
        ------------------
        
        The source can be obtained via mercurial from
        https://bitbucket.org/gocept/nagiosplugin::
        
           hg clone https://bitbucket.org/gocept/nagiosplugin
        
        This package supports installation in a virtualenv using zc.buildout.
        
        
        Creating a build with zc.buildout
        ---------------------------------
        
        First, create a virtualenv if not already present::
        
           virtualenv -p python3.2 .
        
        If you want to use Python 2.7, specify this Python version while creating the
        virtualenv::
        
           virtualenv -p python2.7 .
        
        Sometimes, you will run into strange setuptools/distribute version conflicts.
        The best way around is to keep setuptools and distribute entirely out of the
        virtualenv::
        
           virtualenv -p python3.2 --no-setuptools .
        
        `bootstrap.py` and zc.buildout will take care of all required dependencies.
        
        Then launch the usual buildout steps::
        
           bin/python3.2 bootstrap.py
           bin/buildout
        
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        When the buildout succeeds, run the unit test by invoking::
        
           bin/test
        
        Our `build server`_ runs test against the trunk on a regular basis.
        
        .. image:: https://builds.gocept.com/job/nagiosplugin/badge/icon
           :target: https://builds.gocept.com/job/nagiosplugin/
        .. _build server: https://builds.gocept.com/job/nagiosplugin/
        
        nagiosplugin also includes support for coverage reports. It aims at 100% test
        coverage where possible. The preferred way to get a coverate report is to use ::
        
           bin/createcoverage
        
        to determine test coverage and open the report in a web browser. Alternatively,
        run ::
        
           bin/coverage run bin/test
        
        to get a purely text-based coverage report.
        
        You may run the supplied examples with the local interpreter::
        
           bin/py src/nagiosplugin/examples/check_load.py
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation uses Sphinx. Build the documentation (buildout should have
        been running before to install Sphinx etc.)::
        
           make -C doc html
        
        
        How to release
        --------------
        
        To make a release, we prefer `zest.releaser`_. To make a release, follow
        the standard procedure, which usually boils down to::
        
           fullrelease
        
        `nagiosplugin` tried to obey the semantic version numbering specification
        published on SemVer_ but adapts it a little bit to be `PEP 386`_ compliant.
        
        .. _zest.releaser: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser/
        .. _SemVer: http://semver.org/
        .. _PEP 386: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/
