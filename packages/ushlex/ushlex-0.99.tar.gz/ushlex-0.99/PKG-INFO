Description: 
        Inspired by ordereddict,
        this is a packaging of an improved shlex module for Python 2 that handles
        Unicode properly.
        
        Shlex is """A lexical analyzer class for simple shell-like syntaxes."""
        
        If you've found your way here,
        you probably already know that the standard shlex doesn't handle Unicode prior
        to Python 3
        (see `bug 1170 <http://bugs.python.org/issue1170>`_ for details).
        Since Python 2.7.3 however,
        it accepts unicode objects.
        Sadly, it still does not handle non-ascii chars::
        
            >>> import sys, shlex
            >>> sys.version
            '2.7.5+ ...'
            >>> shlex.split(u'Hello world')
            ['Hello', 'world']
        
            >>> shlex.split(u'café')
            Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
              File "/usr/lib/python2.7/shlex.py", line 275, in split
                lex = shlex(s, posix=posix)
              File "/usr/lib/python2.7/shlex.py", line 25, in __init__
                instream = StringIO(instream)
            UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' in
                                 position 3: ordinal not in range(128)
        
        
        This module does handle unicode objects or byte strings::
        
            >>> import ushlex as shlex
            >>> shlex.split(u'café')
            [u'caf\xe9']
        
            >>> shlex.split(u'echo "☺ ☕ ♫"')
            [u'echo', u'\u263a \u2615 \u266b']
        
            >>> from ushlex import split as shplit
            >>> shplit('echo "hello there"')
            ['echo', 'hello there']
        
        I found these release notes inside::

        Packaging-only bugs may be submitted to bitbucket.
