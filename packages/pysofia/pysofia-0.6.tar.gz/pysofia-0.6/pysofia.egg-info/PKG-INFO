Description: 
        PySofia
        =============================
        
        PySofia is a python wrapper around the methods present in the C++ sofia-ml library. These include Stochastic Gradient Descent implementations of some ranking algorithms, notably RankSVM.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
          - cython >= 0.17 (previous versions will not work)
          - numpy
          - A C++ compiler (gcc will do)
        
        You will not need to install sofia-ml since it is incuded in this distribution
        
        Installation
        ============
        
            $ pip install -U pysofia
        
        
        Methods
        =======
        
        pysofia.train_sgd
        
            Trains a model using stochastic gradient descent. See docstring for
            more details.
        
        pysofia.compat.RankSVM implements an estimator following the conventions
        used in scikit-learn.
