Provide a framework to define configuration stacks.
- Developers use a configuration as a simple dict,
- Users define configurations in various files depending on their needs.

A stack provides a simple dict to developers by assembling user files and
selecting the options where they are defined.

As an example, a user may have a configuration file in its home directory,
one under /etc for system-wide defaults and one in a directory for specific
options.
