        glim is the lightweight MVC(S) (Model, View, Controller, (Service))
        framework on top of werkzeug inspired from play & laravel. The aim is to
        build a lightweight architecture for web app development. The
        development philosophy here is to make the core small as possible but
        still not featureless. It has an extension system that can boot objects
        with configuration.(See `gredis <https://github.com/aacanakin/gredis>`__
        - a redis extension for glim)
        
        The project depends on great open source python projects like
        SQLAlchemy, werkzeug, jinja2, etc.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  A powerful routing system which has grouping & filtering
        -  A model layer with use of SQLAlchemy's ``declarative_base()``
        -  A controller layer for request handling, service calling, etc.
        -  A service layer to seperate database layer logic from models
        -  An object oriented command line layer with use of ``argparse``
        -  An extension system that developers can integrate to the framework
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        -  clone the repo
        -  inside the project folder run following statements; \`\`\` # create a
           virtualenv $ virtualenv venv
        
        activate the virtualenv
        =======================
        
        $ . venv/bin/activate
        
        install the package dependencies
        ================================
        
        $ pip install -r requirements
        
        initialize a new glim app
        =========================
        
        $ python glim.py new
        
        copy the sample configuration into the defined environment
        ==========================================================
        
        $ cp app/config/default.py app/config/development.py

        glim is
        -------
        
        -  small & lightweight
        -  great for painless web app development
        -  great for api development
        
        glim isn't
        ----------
        
        -  django
        -  flask
        -  not stable currently :(
        
        NOTE: I'm changing lots of things currently. So the web server may not
        even start but feel free to play with it!
