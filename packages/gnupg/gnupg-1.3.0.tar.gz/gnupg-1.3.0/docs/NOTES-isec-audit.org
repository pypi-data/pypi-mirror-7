* python-gnupg

** what should be done by 1 May 2013:
- [ ] packaging for pypi
- [ ] unittests
- [ ] leap_mx and soledad should be using python-gnupg

** what the isec folks might want to look at:
*** options
    are there any ways to coerce python-gnupg in strange/buggy ways though its
    allowed options, or, in general, though the API it presents?
*** daemons
    if any of the daemons controlled by, or connected to, leap_mx or soledad
    can be leveraged in any way to execute an a attack using python-gnupg.
*** keyID collision / couchDB key database poisoning
    is there a way to trick python-gnupg into using an incorrect key?
*** identity leaks
    is there a way to analyse the mailserver, leapmx, or soledad, to gain info
    about which key is being used at a particular time?
