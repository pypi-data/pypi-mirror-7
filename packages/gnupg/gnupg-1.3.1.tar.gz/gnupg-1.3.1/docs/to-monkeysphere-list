1) I'm going to package it on pypi, and hopefully Debian as well. I'm sure
   you've noticed, but there's gpgpy, python-gnupg, pygpg, openpgpy,
   python-gpgme, pyme, and I don't even know what else. The namespace is pretty
   crowded, and I'm not sure if I should continue to use 'python-gnupg' because
   mine is fairly distinct from upstream (and upstream hasn't responded, though
   they did make a new release a couple months ago duplicating some of my
   work). Should I change the name? Do you have any ideas for names?

2) If anyone plans to use my version of python-gnupg, is there anything missing
   that I should add, or parts of the API that are awkward? (This is one of the
   things I'm finishing up now.) I don't want to add huge features now, but if
   it was something like "make <packet that is currently skipped> be available
   as an attribute of the result object of <gnupg operation>" then that is
   quite doable.

I just read through monkeysign/msign-cli and monkeysign/msign, and I'm glad
there is a better version of my
written-during-a-ragequit-on-the-amount-of-typing-required-to-certify-a-gpg-key
script. Which is here[1], and not useful to you -- monkeysign is better. 

There is also a script I use for uploading a timestamped, signed copy of my
primary public key and OTR fingerprints,[2] which might be useful, dkg has
suggested that it "get published properly" -- which I took to mean putting it
in caff. I don't particularly care where it goes, as long as no one else has to
write the same thing again. Although I should revise it to include multiple OTR
fingerprint (and probably other identity based key material, like a server's
SSL fingerprint), and also to remove the annoying url-shortened link at L91.
