Hi,

I see on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gnupg that you released this
library under AGPLv3. Is this correct?

If it is, then you might be interested to have a look to this long
ongoing thread on debian-devel mailing-list where I've seen explained
(by people I trust on this topic) that AGPLv3 is really not well
suited for libraries -- to start with, quite some of its terms are
ambiguous when one tries to apply them to a library:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/07/msg00031.html

Cheers,

TBH, I've pointed you at the beginning of the thread because I was too
lazy to go fetch the best email in there. I'm glad it helps anyway.

I've just re-read a bit to confirm, and my conclusion is that: yeah,
as the sole copyright holder (is this the case?) you can freely
re-licence to whatever you want.

I usually do GPL-3+, but I would not be able to defend it seriously
against v2 or v2+.

Np.

Feel free to credit me if you wish, but I certainly don't feel it's
necessary.

I feel a bit lazy to read this thread again to check if it's fine to
publish stuff from there, so if you don't mind, I'd rather skip this
part ;)

Okay, thanks!

/me reads=E2=80=A6

I think this message better describes why AGPL is bad for libraries:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/07/msg00041.html
or, at least, I understood that one better than the first.

I certainly do not want to make problems for Debian, and now that a bunch of
Tor, LEAP, CryptoParty, and Freebox projects, and perhaps soon Pip too, will
be depending on this, I *really* don't want to make anyone else's license h=
ell
worse.

Attached is an email from leap@lists.riseup.net where we had fisticuffs over
licensing opinions, wherein I explained my preference for AGPL for
everything. Essentially, I do not want people/corporations/etc. to use my w=
ork
in a closed source application and then potentially make changes to patch
found vulnerabilities without contributing those patches back to the main
codebase.

Though, you're correct, this doesn't make sense for a library, as a
closed-source web-service frontend to this Python module likely isn't going=
 to
get anyone exploited except the person running the service. So it doesn't m=
ake
as much sense.

Do you know if it is okay for me to re-license it as regular GPL?

Do you have any advice on which of GPLv(2|3)(\+)* that I should use?

Thanks for pointing this out so quickly before it caused trouble, by the
way. :)

I started release everything I could AGPLv3 three years ago, after a
conversation with some other activist free-software devs:

    Me: "I want a license which says 'If you are part of any governing body=
 or
    corporation which contracts to any private or public military entity, t=
hen
    you should go fuck youself. And no, you cannot use my software -- I will
    sue your pants off.'"

    Them: "Isis, that is silly, and even na=C3=AFve. Universities are libra=
ries are
    often 'part of governing bodies', you don't want to exclude them, do yo=
u?
    And also, you're like not going to see the blobs your code is included
    in...it will get privately installed on custom military and law
    enforcement hardware, and when they're done with it it'll go and rot
    outside on a base or in a police confiscation parking lot somewhere."

    Me: "Hum. I hate talking about licenses anyway."

    Them: "Yeah, it sucks. But it's important for us to take this seriously,
    because the tools we're working on have the potential for helping us
    better organise at protests, as well as better help the cops kettle us
    into paddy wagons." [one of the tools was a crisis mapping thing]

    Different one of them: "Perhaps you both should read AGPL, and see if t=
hat
    helps. I don't think using law against them is going to work, because we
    can't assume they will play by the rules, but if we're arguing licenses
    anyway..."

AGPL also seems useful when it seems possible that shady closed-source
startups are going to add a fancier UI or other feature to your code, and t=
hen
market it. This is especially worrying, not because they are "stealing user=
s",
but because it's never clear if vulns discovered in your own code have been
fixed in theirs and vice versa. Or, it could get used in way that is
dangerous, or that it wasn't meant for. (For example, there is currently a
concern that a certain shell company is going to use OONI's code on these
little android-system-on-a-USB dongly thingies...and there are certain dang=
ers
with Tor on Android that these people either don't understand or have no
intention of warning users about.)

Anyway. There is my argument for AGPL.

Though I also hate these discussions, don't care about laws, think reformism
is bunk, WTFPL is the only sane LICENSE, and all that jazz, so I'm going to=
 go
stand over there ----------------------------------------------------------=
->
and watch everybody else duke it out. :)

Hey intrigeri,

I've decided to relicence with your recommendation of GPL3+. Is it okay to
credit you and/or publicly point to these emails as the basis for the
rationale for the switch?
