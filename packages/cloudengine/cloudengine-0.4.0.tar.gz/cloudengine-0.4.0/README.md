===========

**Open source backend for mobile.**


Overview
=========

CloudEngine is an open source backend for building awesome mobile apps built using Python and django.
The aim of the project is to help mobile app developers get their apps off the ground
as quickly as possible. For this, CloudEngine provides basic services
required for building rich mobile apps out-of-the-box. The aim is also to create fully 
customizable and extensible framework for
building backend mobile services.

on UNIX environments. For development purposes, you can use django's builtin webserver.
