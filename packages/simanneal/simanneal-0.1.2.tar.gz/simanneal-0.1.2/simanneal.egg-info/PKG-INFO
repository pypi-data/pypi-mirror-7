Description: `simanneal` is a python implementation of the 
        [simulated annealing optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) technique. 
        
        Simulated annealing is used to find a close-to-optimal solution among an 
        extremely large (but finite) set of potential solutions. It is particularly 
        useful for [combinatorial optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) 
        problems defined by complex objective functions that rely on external data.
