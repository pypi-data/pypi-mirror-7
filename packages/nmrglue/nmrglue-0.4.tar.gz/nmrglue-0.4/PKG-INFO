        What is nmrglue?
        ----------------
        
        nmrglue is a module for working with NMR data in Python. When used with the
        numpy, scipy, and matplotlib packages nmrglue provides a robust interpreted
        environment for processing, analysing, and inspecting NMR data.
        
        What can nmrglue do?
        --------------------
        
        nmrglue has the ability to read, write and convert between a number of common
        NMR file formats including Varian, Bruker, NMRPipe, and Sparky files. The
        files, which are represented in python as dictionaries of spectral parameters
        and Numpy array objects, can be easily examined, modified and processed as
        desired. 
        
        nmrglue provides a number of common functions for processing NMR data such as
        apodization, spectral shifting, Fourier and other transformations, baseline
        smoothing and flattening, and linear prediction. In addition new processing
        schemes can be implemented easily using the nmrglue provided functions and the
        multitude of numerical routines provided by the Numpy and Scipy packages. 
        
        When used in conjunction with the matplotlib (or other) python plotting
        library nmrglue can be used to create publication quality figures of NMR
        spectrum or examine data interactively.
        
        nmrglue can be used to analysis NMR data, with routines to perform peak
        picking, multidimensional lineshape fitting (peak fitting), and peak
        integration. New analysis methods can be rapidly developed and tested in
        Python or by integrating Fortran and C/C++ code.
