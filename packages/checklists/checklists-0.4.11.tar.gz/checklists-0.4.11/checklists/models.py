"""Checklists are used to record the birds seen on a visit to a given location.

A checklist is created for each visit to a location on a given date and
time by one or more observers. Each checklist has a list of entries which
gives the total number of birds for each species seen. For each entry, the
details of the count, which include the age and sex of the birds seen and
information on the direction the birds were flying, can also be recorded.
If a specific methodology was used to survey the location then the details
are described in a protocol associated with the checklist.

The model is also designed to allow easy importing of checklists from other
databases with alias tables to ensure that differences in location names and
species always map to the same object. Unique identifiers for checklists and
entries allow checklists to be imported multiple times in case the original
records were updated and the database will remain consistent.

    easier to work with the standardized name, particularly in conjunction

    names for species onto one of the reference names.

    The common name can be used for displaying more familiar names rather than
    using the standardized name or scientific name. Typical examples are
    Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) which is more commonly known in the
    United Kingdom as simply Turnstone and Great Skua (Stercorarius Skua)
    which is commonly known by it's Shetland name, Bonxie, in the northern
    parts of the UK. Plural name is intended for the plural of the common name.

    Include (default True) allows certain species to be excluded when

    between wild and domestic forms of the sam species, e.g. Greylag Goose
    and Greylag Goose (Domestic type). You could simply add an entry to the
