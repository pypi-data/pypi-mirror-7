"""Checklists are used to record the birds seen on a visit to a given location.

A checklist is created for each visit to a location on a given date and
time by one or more observers. Each checklist has a list of entries which
gives the total number of birds for each species seen. For each entry, the
details of the count, which include the age and sex of the birds seen and
information on the direction the birds were flying, can also be recorded.
If a specific methodology was used to survey the location then the details
are described in a protocol associated with the checklist.

The model is also designed to allow easy importing of checklists from other
databases with alias tables to ensure that differences in location names and
species always map to the same object. Unique identifiers for checklists and
entries allow checklists to be imported multiple times in case the original
records were updated and the database will remain consistent.
