Description: # django-cleanup
        
        django-cleanup automatically deletes old file for FileField, ImageField and subclasses,
        and it also deletes files on models instance deletion.
        
        **Warning! If you use transactions you may lose you files if transaction will rollback. 
        If you are concerned about it you need other solution for old file deletion in your project.**
        
        Most django projects I've seen don't use transactions and this app is designed for such projects.
        
        ## How does it work?
        
        django-cleanup connects pre_save and post_delete signals to special functions(these functions 
        delete old files) for each model which app is listed in INSTALLED_APPS above than 'django_cleanup'.
        
        ## Installation
            
            pip install django-cleanup
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Add django_cleanup to settings.py
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_cleanup', # should go after your apps
            )
        
        **django_cleanup** should be placed after all your apps. (At least after those apps which need to remove files.)
