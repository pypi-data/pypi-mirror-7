        # Changelog
        
        ## 0.3.5
        
        ```python manage.py socketserver``` has been removed, use ```python server.py``` both for development and deployment. 
        
        Multiple connections are now possible:
        
            SOCKJS_CLASSES = (
                ('swampdragon.connections.sockjs_connection.DjangoSubscriberConnection', '/data'),
                ('myproject.connections.CustomConnection', '/myendpoint'),
            )
        
        A lot of changes has been made to the JavaScript libraries to work with multiple connections and be more 'endpoint specific'.
        
        
        ### JavaScript changes
        
        The old ```dataService``` will be removed.
         
        
        #### AngularJS
        With multiple endpoint support, the AngularJS service changes. 
        
        ```dataService``` is renamed to ```$dragon``` 
        
        and all calls requires the endpoint. So ```dataService.getList``` becomes ```$dragon.data.getList``` 
        (where **data** is the name of the endpoint).
        
        Previously $rootScope was used to broadcast when the connection was ready, however with multiple connections
        possible this now changes to ```$dragon.[endpoint].onReady```
        
            $dragon.data.onReady(function() {
                ...
            });
        
        
        The same goes for ```onChannelMessage```.
        
            // Previously
            $scope.$on('handleChannelMessage', function(e, channels, message) { ... });
            
            // Now
            $dragon.data.onChannelMessage(function(channels, message) { ... });
        
        
        #### JavaScript settings 
        
        Settings needs to be included in the template
         
            <script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:9999/settings.js"></script>
            
        (remember to change localhost to your server url / domain name)
