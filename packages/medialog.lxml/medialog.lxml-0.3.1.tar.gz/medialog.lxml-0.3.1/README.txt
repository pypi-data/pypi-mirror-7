About the views and behavior
============================

- This is slightly experimental. Please give feedback and suggestions.

- The embed views might be insecure, although if you are restrictive with the settings in the control panel you should be able to filter out evil code.



How to embed another webpage in your site
=========================================

- go to control panel.

- in the medialog.control panel, set *default settings for your embed views*

- add a dexterity content type

- add  LXML embed behaviour 

- Add a content type to your site and enter embed details

- go to http://plonesite/content/scrape_view 

- You probably want to add the view to the contenttype TTW



How add content from another webpage in your site
=================================================

- be sure to set up whitelist and url pairs in the control panel
- go to a folder
- add /@@createpage?url=http://url/of/somepage
- go to your folder: a new page should have been added 
- PS: Settings in the medialog control panel and html safe settings are taken into account


How batch add content from other webpages in your site
=================================================
