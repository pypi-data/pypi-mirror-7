Description: golang for virtualenvwrapper
        ============================
        
        Very simple, effective go virtual environments that work directly with
        python's virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        It's just a virtualenvwrapper extension!
        
        If you are already using that, just
        
          $ pip install govenv
        
        And next time you make a virtualenv by using ``mkvirtualenv`` it will create
        a ``gopath`` directory in your venv folder to hold all your golang source.
        Now, whenever you activate that it will set your ``GOPATH`` and ``PATH``,
        and return it to its previous setting when you deactive.
        
        It's extremely simple, you should just look at the source:
        `gopath.py <https://github.com/termie/govenv/tree/master/govenv/gopath.py>`_
