Description: ftw.notification.base
        =====================
        
        This package provides a notification system for plone for sending
        notifications when a content is changed.
        
        Every edit-form is extended with a checkbox for sending a notification after
        the modification on the content is done. When checked, the user will see a
        form after submitting the changes, where he can select multiple persons to
        be notified and add a comment.
        
        This package does not contain the actual implementation of sending the
        notification. It is designed so that the type of notification can be
        replaced. Any type of notification can be implemented like this (e.g. email,
        jabber, irc, physical letter).
