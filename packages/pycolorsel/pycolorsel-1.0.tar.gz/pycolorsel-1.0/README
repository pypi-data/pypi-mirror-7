Application: pycolorsel
Author: Glenn Schemenauer [GSchemenauer3@gmail.com]

ABOUT
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple Python script which uses the GTK+ (2.x version)
widget toolkit to display a window where a color can be selected
without having to launch or download a full-blown image editing
program.

To run the script, make pycolorsel.py (the main file) executable
with a chmod +x pycolorsel.py if necessary or just double click
the file.  Alternatively, run via command line.

REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Python
2. PyGTK modules

NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------
The script was written using Python 2.6.5 under Linux.  It would
probably work under 3.x as well provided you have the correct
modules available.
