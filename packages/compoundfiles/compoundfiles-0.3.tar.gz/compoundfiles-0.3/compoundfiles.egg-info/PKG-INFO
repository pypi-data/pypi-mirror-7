        This package provides a library for reading Microsoft's `Compound File Binary`_
        format (CFB), formerly known as `OLE Compound Documents`_, the `Advanced
        Authoring Format`_ (AAF), or just plain old Microsoft Office files (the non-XML
        sort). This format is also widely used with certain media systems and a number
        of scientific applications (tomography and microscopy).
        
        The code is pure Python and should run on any platform; it is compatible with
        Python 2.7 (or above) and Python 3.2 (or above). The library has an emphasis
        on rigour and performs numerous validity checks on opened files.  By default,
        the library merely warns when it comes across non-fatal errors in source files
        but this behaviour is configurable by developers through Python's ``warnings``
        mechanisms.
