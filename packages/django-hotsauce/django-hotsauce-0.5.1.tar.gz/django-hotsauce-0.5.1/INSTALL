INSTALL
========

To compile and install with /usr/local/bin/python:

    % sudo ./bootstrap /usr/local/bin/python
    % make depend
    % make 
    % sudo make install

Note that you should use GNU make and not /usr/bin/make if you're
using a BSD system. On linux, gmake should be aliased as /usr/bin/make.

The old way:

    % python setup.py build 
    % sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

To develop locally, you can use the "develop" command provided by
setuptools to install a symlink to the source directory:

    % sudo make develop

To build the documentation, Sphinx and Doxygen are needed. Sphinx
is used to build the standard documentation and Doxygen for the API
documentation. 

    % sudo make doxygen          # generate the API docs
    % make -f docs/Makefile html # generate the HTML docs (work-in-progress)

Finally you should install djangorc.sample to $HOME/.djangorc...

    % cp djangorc.sample $HOME/.djangorc

Then in your $HOME/.profile, add the following lines to enable automatic
django configuration upon login:

    [ -r "$HOME/.djangorc" ] && . $HOME/.djangorc
