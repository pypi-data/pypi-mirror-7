INSTALL
========

1) Backup your current Django tree, unless you don't care about
losing data! *:-)

2) Import the desired patch set in ``$DJANGO_HOME``, assuming you have set
that variable in your environment already:

    $ cd $DJANGO_HOME
    $ hg init && hg qinit   # init a new hg and mq repos (recommended step)
    $ hg add ...            # creates a pristine copy (optional step)
    $ hg commit             # and commit..
    
3) Import patches from a specific directory into your Django tree:

    $ hg clone http://joelia.gthc.org/django-bugfixes django-bugfixes
    $ ls django-bugfixes/*.patch | xargs hg qimport 
    $ hg qpush -a 

.. note:: 

    In case of problems, repair the faulty patch and issue ``hg qrefresh`` to
    update the patch. Repeat as necessary until all patches apply cleanly. Also 
    you can use the "--git" flag to create patches in diff format as opposed
    to a HG changeset patch, which is not really portable as opposed to the 
    GNU diff format. 

4) Verify if notmm is working properly with the new custom patches:

    $ cd notmm--<VERSION>/tests
    $ cat ./runtest.sh | sh -x
