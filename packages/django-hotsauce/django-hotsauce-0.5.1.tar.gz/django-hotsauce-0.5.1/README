 
 Django-hotsauce 0.5.0
 =====================

 Welcome to the notmm toolkit, a open web application 
 platform written in Python.  
 
 The notmm/django-hotsauce toolkit aims to provide tools for rapid web application
 development and testing on top of the Django framework and WSGI.

 Getting Started
 ---------------

 Please read the "INSTALL" file for last-minutes considerations
 before attempting a build.

 Documentation
 -------------

 The full documentation is being generated using the Sphinx toolkit, 
 by entering "make -f docs/Makefile" or "make html". 
 
 In addition, to skip building API docs, set the variable 
 "WITHOUT_DOXYGEN" to "1" for faster execution time.
