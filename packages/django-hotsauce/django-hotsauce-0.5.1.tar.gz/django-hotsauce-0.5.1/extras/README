Place holder directory for applications I maintain in this distribution but
wish they were distinct packages:

- blogengine 
- libauthkit
- libschevo (require cogen, Durus)
- wikiapp (require MoinMoin)
- restapp (deprecated)
- wsgiapp (moved into blogengine)

The command:

    $ python ./setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local 

can be used to install this package group in /usr/local.
