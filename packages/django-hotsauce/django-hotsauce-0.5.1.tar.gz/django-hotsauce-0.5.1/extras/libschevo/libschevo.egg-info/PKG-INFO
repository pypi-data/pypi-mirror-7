Description: 
        Schevo is a next-generation DBMS that focuses on the following:
        
        * **Rapid Development**.
        
          It's easy and fun to create even the most complex of
          databases. Easily write and understand schema syntax. Quickly
          place required initial data directly in your schema; use the
          same syntax to create sets of sample data for development use.
        
        * **Rich Schema Definition**.
        
          Write database schemata using concise, easy-to-read Python
          code. Your schema will describe not only database structure, but
          also all transactions and rules that ensure database integrity.
        
        * **Automated Schema Evolution**.
        
          Deploy a Schevo database and use it to store valuable data, then
          easily make further changes to the structure of the
          database. Use Schevo's tools to help restructure a database and
          safely migrate data from one schema version to the next.
        
        * **Transaction Based**.
        
          Schevo protects your data. Use transactions to make all changes
          to a Schevo database (it's the only way it allows you to!), and
          you can trust Schevo to ensure that your database is left in a
          consistent state at all times.
        
        * **User Interface Generation**.
        
          User interface code takes advantage of the richness of your
          database schema. Use a full-featured database navigator to
          interact with your database without writing a single line of
          code outside your database schema. Build customized UIs using
          Schevo-aware widgets and UI tools.
