Description: 
        Lapels remaps reads aligned to the in silico genome back to the reference
        coordinate and annotates variants.
        
        Two files are taken as input:
            (1) a MOD file that is used to generate the in silico genome and
            (2) a BAM file that contains the in silico genome alignments.
        
        Lapels will generate a new BAM file with corrected read positions, adjusted
        cigar strings, and annotated tags of variants (eg. SNPs, Insertions, and
        Deletions).
