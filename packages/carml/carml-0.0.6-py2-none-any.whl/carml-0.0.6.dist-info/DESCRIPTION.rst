carml
=====

``carml`` is a command-line tool to query and control a running Tor
(including Tor Browser Bundle). You can do things like:

 * list and remove streams and circuits;
 * monitor stream, circuit and address-map events;
 * watch for any Tor event and print it (or many) out;
 * monitor bandwidth;
 * run any Tor control-protocol command;
 * pipe through common Unix tools like ``grep``, ``less``, ``cut``, etcetera;
 * download TBB through Tor, with pinned certs and signature checking;
 * ...even spit out and run ``xplanet`` configs (with router/circuit markers)!

It is written in Python and uses Tor's control-port via the `txtorcon
library <https://txtorcon.readthedocs.org>`_.

**Documentation at:** `carml.rtfd.org <https://carml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

In some ways, ``carml`` started as a dumping-ground for things I
happened to make Tor do at least once from Python code. Are there
things you wish you could easily make Tor do from the command-line?
File an enhancement bug at GitHub!

``carml`` is also easy to extend, even with system- or `virtualenv
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_- installed
packages.

Feedback is appreciated -- pull-requests and bug-reports (including
feature enhancements) welcome `at GitHub
<https://github.com/meejah/carml>`_ or you can contact me in `#tor-dev
on OFTC <irc://irc.oftc.net/tor-dev>`_ or via *meejah at meejah dot
ca* with the public-key contained in the source.

**I'm happy to accept a new logo** if it is open-licensed somehow;
obviously I'm no logo-designer ;)

    People using Tor Browser Bundle can find your paste at (once the descriptor uploads):

    If you wish to keep the hidden-service keys, they're in (until we shut down):
