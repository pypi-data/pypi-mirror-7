.. _circ:

``circ``
========

Play with your circuits. You can do a few main actions:

 * ``--list`` (``-L``) list the current circuits (similar to ``carml monitor``).
 * ``--build`` (``-b``) build a new circuit, either specifying relays by hand or "auto" to let Tor select.
 * ``--delete`` to delete a circuit (pass ``--if-unused`` or ``-u`` to only delete it after it's no longer used).

The ``~`` characters in the names means that router doesn't have the "Named" flag.
