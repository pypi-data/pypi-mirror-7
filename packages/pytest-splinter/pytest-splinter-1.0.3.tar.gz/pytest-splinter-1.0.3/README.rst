Features
========

The plugin provides many useful fixtures to be used if you’re using splinter for browser testing


Fixtures
========

* browser
    Get the splinter's Browser. Fixture is underneath session scoped, so browser process is started
    once per test session.

* splinter_selenium_implicit_wait
    Implicit wait timeout to be passed to Selenium webdriver.
    Fixture gets the value from the command-line option splinter-implicit-wait (see below)

* splinter_selenium_speed
    Speed for Selenium, if not 0 then it will sleep between each selenium command.
    Useful for debugging/demonstration.
    Fixture gets the value from the command-line option splinter-speed (see below)

* splinter_selenium_socket_timeout
    Socket timeout for communication between the webdriver and the browser.
    Fixture gets the value from the command-line option splinter-socket-timeout (see below)

* splinter_webdriver
    Splinter's webdriver name to use. Fixture gets the value from the command-line option
    splinter-webdriver (see below)

* splinter_session_scoped_browser
    pytest-splinter should use single browser instance per test session.
    Fixture gets the value from the command-line option splinter-session-scoped-browser (see below)

* splinter_file_download_dir
    Directory, to which browser will automatically download the files it
    will experience during browsing. For example when you click on some download link.
    By default it's a temporary directory. Automatic downloading of files is only supported for firefox driver
    at the moment.

* splinter_download_file_types
    Comma-separated list of content types to automatically download.
    By default it's the all known system mime types (via mimetypes standard library).

* splinter_browser_load_condition
    Browser load condition, python function which should return True.
    If function returns False, it will be run several times, until timeout below reached.

* splinter_browser_load_timeout
    Browser load condition timeout in seconds, after this timeout the exception
    WaitUntilTimeout will be raised.

* splinter_firefox_profile_preferences
    Firefox profile preferences, a dictionary which is passed to selenium
    webdriver's profile_preferences

* splinter_driver_kwargs
    Webdriver keyword arguments, a dictionary which is passed to selenium
    webdriver's constructor (after applying firefox preferences)

* splinter_window_size
    Size of the browser window on browser initialization. Tuple in form (<width>, <height>). Default is (1366, 768)


Command-line options
====================

* `--splinter-implicit-wait`
    Selenium webdriver implicit wait. Seconds (default: 1).

* `--splinter-speed`
    selenium webdriver speed (from command to command). Seconds (default: 0).

* `--splinter-socket-timeout`
    Selenium webdriver socket timeout for for communication between the webdriver and the browser.
    Seconds (default: 120).

* `--splinter-webdriver`
    Webdriver name to use. (default: firefox). Options:

    *  firefox
    *  remote
    *  chrome
    *  phantomjs

    For more details, refer to splinter and selenium documentation.

* `--splinter-session-scoped-browser`
    pytest-splinter should use single browser instance per test session. (set by default).


Browser fixture
===============

As mentioned above, browser is a fixture made by creating splinter's Browser object, but with some overrides.

*  visit
    Added possibility to wait for condition on each browser visit by having a fixture.

*  wait_for_condition
    Method copying selenium's wait_for_condition, with difference that condition is in python,
    so there you can do whatever you want, and not only execute javascript via browser.evaluate_script.

*  `status_code <http://splinter.cobrateam.info/docs/http-status-code-and-exception.html>`_
    This functionality is removed, so not available. Splinter implements this using additional request from python side,
    which is in general performance-wise not a good idea. Also normally when you interact with the browser as a user,
    you don't need the status code of the page.


Python3 support
===============

Python3 is supported, check if you have recent version of splinter as it was added recently.


Example
=======

test_your_test.py:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_some_browser_stuff(browser):
        """Test using real browser."""
        url = "http://www.google.com"
        browser.visit(url)
        browser.fill('q', 'splinter - python acceptance testing for web applications')
        # Find and click the 'search' button
        button = browser.find_by_name('btnK')
        # Interact with elements
        button.click()
        assert browser.is_text_present('splinter.cobrateam.info'), 'splinter.cobrateam.info wasn't found... We need to'
