TODO
====

- clone z3c.recipe.egg:script recipe and support

  environ, this is not supported zc.recipe.egg 

- fix documentation setup

  - describe recipes in README.txt or include all relevant sub docs


- ctags doesn't work with too many packages in sys.path on windows because the
  cmd can't be too large.

  see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/830473/de

  Fix this with generating a file and use the config file with -L option
  in all _build_* methods where we use self.path

  see: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html#OPTIONS
