0.3 (2014-06-23)
================

- Ability to absorb paths entirely in path directive, as per issue #132.

- Refactor of config engine to make Venusian and immediate config more
  clear.

- Typo fix in docs (Remco Wendt).

- Get version number in docs from setuptools.

- Fix changelog so that PyPI page generates HTML correctly.

- Fix PDF generation so that the full content is generated.

- Ability to mark a view as internal. It will be available to
  ``request.view()`` but will give 404 on the web. This is useful for
  structuring JSON views for reusability where you don't want them to
  actually show up on the web.

- A ``request.child(something).view()`` that had this view in turn
  call a ``request.view()`` from the context of the ``something``
  application would fail -- it would not be able to look up the view
  as lookups still occurred in the context of the mounting
  application. This is now fixed. (thanks Ying Zhong for reporting it)

  Along with this fix refactored the request object so it keeps a
  simple ``mounted`` attribute instead of a stack of ``mounts``; the
  stack-like nature was not in use anymore as mounts themselves have
  parents anyway. The new code is simpler.

0.2 (2014-04-24)
================

- Python 3 support, in particular Python 3.4 (Alec Munro - fudomunro
  on github).

- Link generation now takes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` into account.

- Morepath 0.1 had a security system, but it was undocumented. Now
  it's documented (docs now in `Morepath Security`_), and some of its behavior was
  slightly tweaked:

  * new ``verify_identity`` directive.

  * ``permission`` directive was renamed to ``permission_rule``.

  * default unauthorized error is 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized.

  * ``morepath.remember`` and ``morepath.forbet`` renamed to
    ``morepath.remember_identity`` and ``morepath.forget_identity``.

- Installation documentation tweaks. (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)

- ``.gitignore`` tweaks (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)
