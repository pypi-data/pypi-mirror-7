Skyfield is a pure-Python astronomy package
that makes it easy to generate high precision research-grade
positions for planets and Earth satellites.
You can compute either geocentric coordinates
as shown in the example above,
or topocentric coordinates specific to your location
on the Earthâ€™s surface:

.. testcode::

    boston = earth.topos('42.3583 N', '71.0636 W')
    alt, az, d = boston(now()).observe(mars).apparent().altaz()

    print(alt)
    print(az)

.. testoutput::

    64deg 44' 50.1"
    184deg 17' 16.9"
