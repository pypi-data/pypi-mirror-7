      pipsi = pip script installer

    What does it do?  pipsi is a wrapper around virtualenv and pip
    which installs scripts provided by python packages into separate
    virtualenvs to shield them from your system and each other.

    In other words: you can use pipsi to install things like
    pygmentize without making your system painful.

    How do I get it?

      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/master/get-pipsi.py | python

    How does it work?

    pipsi installs each package into ~/.local/venvs/PGKNAME and then
    symlinks all new scripts into ~/.local/bin.

    Installing scripts from a package:

      $ pipsi install Pygments

    Uninstalling packages and their scripts:

      $ pipsi uninstall Pygments
