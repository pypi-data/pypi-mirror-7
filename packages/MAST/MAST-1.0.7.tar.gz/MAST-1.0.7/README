MAST version "coracle" 2014_04_21
* Reorganized phonons - multiple phonons for defects and nebs
* Each NEB may have a different number of images
* Improved MAST error handling (for mastmon detected errors) and directory locking
* Improved and split mast-level logging (MAST_CONTROL/mast.log) and recipe-level logging (recipe directory, mast_recipe.log)
* Ability to skip recipes (MAST_SKIP file in recipe directory) and ingredients within recipes
      ("skip" status in status.txt file in recipe directory)
* Ability to set mast_frozen_seconds for each ingredient type
* Ability to specify auto-error-correction or the writing of MAST_ERROR with the ingredient-level error message
      encountered. MAST_ERROR will also cause the recipe to be skipped over by MAST.
      Use mast_auto_correct in input file as True or False.
* Generic ingredient (for genetic algorithm and other scripts)
* Multiple methods allowed for mast_xxx_method keywords, as well as custom methods, and methods with arguments.
