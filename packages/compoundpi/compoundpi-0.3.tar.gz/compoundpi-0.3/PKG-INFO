        ===========
        Compound Pi
        ===========
        
        This project provides a means for controlling multiple `cameras`_ attached to
        `Raspberry Pis`_ all of which are attached to the same subnet. Broadcast UDP
        packets are utilized to permit near-simultaneous triggering of all attached
        cameras.
        
        The code is licensed under the `GPL v3`_ or above. Packages can be
        `downloaded`_ from PyPI. The `source code`_ can be obtained from GitHub, which
        also hosts the `bug tracker`_. The `documentation`_ (which includes
        installation and quick start examples) can be read on ReadTheDocs.
