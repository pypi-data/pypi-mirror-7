Compound Pi
===========

This project provides a means for controlling multiple `cameras`_ attached to
`Raspberry Pis`_ all of which are attached to the same subnet. Broadcast UDP
packets are utilized to permit near-simultaneous triggering of all attached
cameras.

The code is licensed under the `GPL v3`_ or above. Packages can be
`downloaded`_ from PyPI. The `source code`_ can be obtained from GitHub, which
also hosts the `bug tracker`_. The `documentation`_ (which includes
installation and quick start examples) can be read on ReadTheDocs.
