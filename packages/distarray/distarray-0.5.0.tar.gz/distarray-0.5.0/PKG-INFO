Description: 
        DistArray
        =========
        
        *Think globally, act locally.*
        
        DistArray provides general multidimensional NumPy-like distributed arrays to
        Python.  It intends to bring the strengths of NumPy to data-parallel
        high-performance computing.  DistArray has a similar API to `NumPy`_.
        
        DistArray is ready for real-world testing and deployment; however, the project
        is still evolving rapidly, and we appreciate continued input from the
        scientific-Python community.
        
        DistArray is for users who
        
        * know and love Python and NumPy,
        * want to scale NumPy to larger distributed datasets,
        * want to interactively play with distributed data but also
        * want to run batch-oriented distributed programs;
        * want an easier way to drive and coordinate existing MPI-based codes,
        * have a lot of data that may already be distributed,
        * want a global view ("think globally") with local control ("act locally"),
        * need to tap into existing parallel libraries like Trilinos, PETSc, or
          Elemental,
        * want the interactivity of IPython and the performance of MPI.
        
        DistArray is designed to work with other packages that implement the
        `Distributed Array Protocol`_.
