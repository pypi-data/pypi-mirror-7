What is DistArray?
------------------

DistArray aims to bring the ease-of-use of NumPy to data-parallel
high-performance computing.  It provides distributed multi-dimensional NumPy
arrays, distributed ufuncs, and distributed IO capabilities.  It can
efficiently interoperate with external distributed libraries like Trilinos.
DistArray works with NumPy and builds on top of it in a flexible and natural
way.

0.5 Release
-----------

Noteworthy improvements in this release include:

* closer alignment with NumPy's API,
* support for Python 3.4 (existing support for Python 2.7 and 3.3),
* a performance-oriented MPI-only mode for deployment on clusters and
  supercomputers,
* a way to register user-defined functions to be callable locally on worker
  processes,
* more consistent naming of sub-packages,
* testing with MPICH2 (already tested against OpenMPI),
* improved and expanded examples,
* installed version testable via ``distarray.test()``, and
* performance and scaling improvements.

With this release, DistArray ready for real-world testing and deployment.  The
project is still evolving rapidly and we appreciate the continued input from
the larger scientific-Python community.

Existing features
-----------------

DistArray:

* supports NumPy-like slicing, reductions, and ufuncs on distributed
  multidimensional arrays;
* has a client-engine process design -- data resides on the worker processes,
  commands are initiated from master;
* allows full control over what is executed on the worker processes and
  integrates transparently with the master process;
* allows direct communication between workers, bypassing the master process
  for scalability;
* integrates with IPython.parallel for interactive creation and exploration of
  distributed data;
* supports distributed ufuncs (currently without broadcasting);
* builds on and leverages MPI via MPI4Py in a transparent and user-friendly
  way;
* has basic support for unstructured arrays;
* supports user-controllable array distributions across workers (block,
  cyclic, block-cyclic, and unstructured) on a per-axis basis;
* has a straightforward API to control how an array is distributed;
* has basic plotting support for visualization of array distributions;
* separates the array’s distribution from the array’s data -- useful for
  slicing, reductions, redistribution, broadcasting, and other operations;
* implements distributed random arrays;
* supports ``.npy``-like flat-file IO and hdf5 parallel IO (via ``h5py``);
  leverages MPI-based IO parallelism in an easy-to-use and transparent way;
  and
* supports the distributed array protocol [protocol]_, which allows
  independently developed parallel libraries to share distributed arrays
  without copying, analogous to the PEP-3118 new buffer protocol.

Planned features and roadmap
----------------------------

Near-term features and improvements include:

* array re-distribution capabilities;
* lazy evaluation and deferred computation for latency hiding;
* interoperation with Trilinos [Trilinos]_; and
* distributed broadcasting support.

The longer-term roadmap includes:

* Integration with other packages [petsc]_ that subscribe to the distributed
  array protocol [protocol]_;
* Distributed fancy indexing;
* Out-of-core computations;
* Support for distributed sorting and other non-trivial distributed
  algorithms; and
* End-user control over communication and temporary array creation, and other
  performance aspects of distributed computations.

History and funding
-------------------

Brian Granger started DistArray as a NASA-funded SBIR project in 2008.
Enthought picked it up as part of a DOE Phase II SBIR [SBIR]_ to provide a
generally useful distributed array package.  It builds on NumPy, MPI, MPI4Py,
IPython, IPython.parallel, and interfaces with the Trilinos suite of
distributed HPC solvers (via PyTrilinos [Trilinos]_).
