DistArray |version|
===================

*Think globally, act locally.*

DistArray provides general multidimensional NumPy-like distributed arrays to
Python.  It intends to bring the strengths of NumPy to data-parallel
high-performance computing.  DistArray has a similar API to `NumPy`_.

DistArray is ready for real-world testing and deployment; however, the project
is still evolving rapidly, and we appreciate continued input from the
scientific-Python community.

DistArray is for users who

* know and love Python and NumPy,
* want to scale NumPy to larger distributed datasets,
* want to interactively play with distributed data but also
* want to run batch-oriented distributed programs;
* want an easier way to drive and coordinate existing MPI-based codes,
* have a lot of data that may already be distributed,
* want a global view ("think globally") with local control ("act locally"),
* need to tap into existing parallel libraries like Trilinos, PETSc, or
  Elemental,
* want the interactivity of IPython and the performance of MPI.

DistArray is designed to work with other packages that implement the
`Distributed Array Protocol`_.

.. _NumPy: http://www.numpy.org


Installation
------------

Dependencies for DistArray:

* NumPy
* IPython
* Mpi4Py

Optional dependencies:

* For HDF5 IO: h5py built against a parallel-enabled build of HDF5
* For plotting: matplotlib

If you have the above, you should be able to install this package with::

    python setup.py install

or::

    python setup.py develop


To run the tests, you will need to start an IPython.parallel cluster.  You can
use ``ipcluster``, or you can use the ``dacluster`` command which comes with
DistArray::

    dacluster start

You should then be able to run all the tests from the DistArray source
directory with::

    make test

or from anywhere with::

    python -m distarray.run_tests


Building the docs
-----------------

Dependencies to build the documentation:

* Sphinx
* sphinxcontrib.napoleon
* sphinxcontrib.programoutput

If you have the dependencies listed above, and you want to build the
documentation (also available at http://distarray.readthedocs.org), navigate to
the ``docs`` subdirectory of the DistArray source and use the Makefile there.

For example, to build the html documentation::

    make html

from the ``docs`` directory.

Try::

    make help

for more options.


Getting Started
---------------

To see some initial examples of what DistArray can do, check out the IPython
notebooks and python scripts in the ``examples`` directory.  To start, see the
`features`_ notebook, also viewable on nbviewer.

If you have questions or would like to contribute, contact us

* on the DistArray mailing list:  distarray.googlegroups.com,
* in the DistArray IRC channel: #distarray on freenode, or
* through the DistArray GitHub repo: https://github.com/enthought/distarray
  (for bug reports and pull requests).

History
-------

DistArray was started by Brian Granger in 2008 and is currently being developed
at Enthought by a team led by Kurt Smith, in partnership with Bill Spotz from
Sandia's (Py)Trilinos project and Brian Granger and Min RK from the IPython
project.
