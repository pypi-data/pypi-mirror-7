DistArray
=========

*Think globally, act locally.*

DistArray provides general multidimensional NumPy-like distributed arrays to
Python.  It intends to bring the strengths of NumPy to data-parallel
high-performance computing.  DistArray has a similar API to `NumPy`_.

DistArray is ready for real-world testing and deployment; however, the project
is still evolving rapidly, and we appreciate continued input from the
scientific-Python community.

DistArray is for users who

* know and love Python and NumPy,
* want to scale NumPy to larger distributed datasets,
* want to interactively play with distributed data but also
* want to run batch-oriented distributed programs;
* want an easier way to drive and coordinate existing MPI-based codes,
* have a lot of data that may already be distributed,
* want a global view ("think globally") with local control ("act locally"),
* need to tap into existing parallel libraries like Trilinos, PETSc, or
  Elemental,
* want the interactivity of IPython and the performance of MPI.

DistArray is designed to work with other packages that implement the
`Distributed Array Protocol`_.
