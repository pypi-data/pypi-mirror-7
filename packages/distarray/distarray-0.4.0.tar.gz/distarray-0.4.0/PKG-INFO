Description: 
        DistArray
        =========
        
        *Think globally, act locally.*
        
        
        DistArray provides general multidimensional NumPy-like distributed-memory
        arrays for Python.  These arrays are designed to look and feel just like
        `NumPy`_ arrays but to take advantage of parallel architectures with
        distributed memory.  
        
        The project is currently under heavy development and things are changing
        quickly!
        
        DistArray is targeting users who
        
        * know and love Python and NumPy,
        * want to interactively play with distributed data,
        * want to run batch-oriented distributed programs,
        * want an easier way to drive and coordinate existing MPI-based codes,
        * have a lot of data that may already be distributed,
        * want a global view ("think globally") with local control ("act locally"),
        * need to tap into existing parallel libraries like Trilinos, PETSc, or
          Elemental,
        * want the interactivity of IPython and the performance of MPI.
