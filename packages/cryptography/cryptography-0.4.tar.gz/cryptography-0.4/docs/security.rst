Security
========

We take the security of ``cryptography`` seriously. If you believe you've
identified a security issue in it, please report it to
``alex.gaynor@gmail.com``. Message may be encrypted with PGP using key
fingerprint ``E27D 4AA0 1651 72CB C5D2  AF2B 125F 5C67 DFE9 4084`` (this public
key is available from most commonly-used key servers).

Once you've submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment
within 48 hours, and depending on the action to be taken, you may receive
further follow-up emails.
