tiddlywebplugins.links is a tool for managing and presenting the
front and backlinks from tiddlers in a TiddlyWeb installation.

There are two main parts:

* A tiddler parser which finds links and updates a database.
* Two web handlers which look in that database to present
  information at 

  /bags/{bag_name}/tiddlers/{tiddler_title}/frontlinks
  /bags/{bag_name}/tiddlers/{tiddler_title}/backlinks

This system uses pyparsing to scan for links. Pyparsing used
with help from http://onlamp.com/lpt/a/6435
