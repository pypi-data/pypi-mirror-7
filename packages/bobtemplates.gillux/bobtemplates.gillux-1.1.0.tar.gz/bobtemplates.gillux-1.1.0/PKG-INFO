Description: ===================
        bobtemplates.gillux
        ===================
        
        Python package templates for `mr.bob <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.bob/>`_.
        Please read carefully `mr.bob user documentation
        <http://mrbob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ before using this
        package.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code:: console
        
           easy_install bobtemplates.gillux
        
        .. warning::
        
           `mr.bob`_ is a requirement for ``bobtemplates.gillux``. For a reason I
           didn't investigate in depth, installing with **pip** like this raises a
           mysterious ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when installing the required `mr.bob`_
           package as requirement:
        
           .. code:: console
        
              pip install bobtemplates.gillux
              | (lots of noise)
              | UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode...
        
           If you really hate ``easy_install`` and want absolutely use ``pip``, this
           works:
        
           .. code:: console
        
              pip install mr.bob
              pip install bobtemplates.gillux
        
           But I can't understand why ;)
        
        About the templates
        ===================
        
        ``bobtempaltes.gillux`` offers the following templates :
        
        buildout
        
          A simple minimal zc.buildout based project bootstrap
        
        mybobtemplate
        
          Make your own **bobtemplate.yourname** bootstrap in a some seconds (or more).
        
        nspackage
        
          A regular Python package bootstrap with or without namespace, any level with
          lots of goodies.
        
        buildout
        --------
        
        Usage:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           mrbob [options] bobtemplates.gillux:buildout
        
        This provides a minimal zc.buildout based project, with a ``bootstrap.py``
        file and a buildout.cfg file. Takes care of differences between versions 1.x
        and 2.x of zc.buildout.
        
        mybobtemplate
        -------------
        
        Usage:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           mrbob [options] bobtemplates.gillux:mybobtemplate
        
        Make your own **bobtemplate.yourname** package in a few minutes (or more).
        Means that you can have the skeleton of a package like ``bobtemplates.gillux``
        in some seconds.
        
        You just need to add the content of your template as described in the `mr.bob
        documentation`_
        
        nspackage
        ---------
        
        Usage:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           mrbob [options] bobtemplates.gillux:nspackage
        
        A regular Python package bootstrap with following features:
        
        - Any namespaces level you want, even none at all. This is detected with the
          name you provide in the wizard.
        
        - Code targeted to Python 2.4 to 2.7 and 3.x
        
        Two optional features:
        
        - Tests with `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ and
          `coverage <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/>`_. Run them with
          ``nosetests``. Tune your options in generated ``setup.cfg``.
        
        - A `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation skeleton. Build the HTML
          doc with ``python setup.py build_sphinx``. The doctest files may optionally
          be automatically included in the doc.
        
        Package files outline (may change depending on options::
        
          src/<your>/<package>/  # Your package source skeleton
          docs/                  # Sphinx source tree skeleton
          tests/                 # Test module skeleton with nose goodies
          setup.py               # Usual setup script
          setup.cfg
          README.rst
          MANIFEST.in
        
        Then grep - and optionally fix - the ``FIXME:`` that occur in the resulting
        files tree for optional stuffs I couldn't fix easily with the regular mr.bob
        features.
        
        Read the generated ``README.rst`` in your newly created package for more
        information about what you got.
        
        **TODO**
        
        - Provide a `six <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/>`_ support option
        
        - Tests inside the source tree (in src/<your>/<package>/tests) OR in the
          package root. Sometimes we prefer to ship source distros with the tests, and
          sometimes (i.e big amount of test data) we prefer to keep a source dist
          small.

        Changes log
        ===========
        
        1.1.0
        -----
        
        - nspackage: Distro name and package (Python) name can be distinct.
          [glenfant]
        
        - nspackage: Use of nosetests + coverage is optional
          [glenfant]
        
        - nspackage: Sphinx doc skeleton is optional
          [glenfant]
        
        1.0.0
        -----
        
        - Added the "mybobtemplate" template for new bobtemplates.xxx packages skeletons.
          [glenfant]
        
        - Added .xxignore files for git, bazaar and mercurial to the "buildout" template.
          [glenfant]
        
        - setuptools/distribute don't let us distribute empty directories. So we need to put
          a marker file in some directories then remove them.
          [glenfant]
        
        1.0.0b1
        -------
        
        - Python 3 support (alpha). Please feeback
          [glenfant]
        
        - Added the "buildout" template, a minimal zc.buildout project bootstrap
          [glenfant]
        
        - Added .xxignore files for git, bazaar and mercurial
          [glenfant]
        
        - Gone through the weirdness of include_package_data, package_data and MANIFEST.in
          This setuptools / distribute feature really sucks
