v1.2.1 (28-06-2014)
-------------------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Fixed the methods ``Deck.find``, ``Deck.get``, and ``Deck.peek``, so they don't throw an error when there is nothing to return. They now return ``None`` if nothing is found.

Other
^^^^^

- Changed ``__init__.py``, so it now imports everything from the module, meaning you can now access the globals constants, and ``check_term``, when importing PyDealer.
- Stripped the extra "\n" at the end of the str representation of a ``Deck``.

v1.2.0 (25-06-2014)
-------------------

Changes
^^^^^^^

- Moved the constants ``Deck.SUITS``, ``Deck.FACES``, and ``Deck.NUMBERS`` out of ``Deck`` and into the global scope. They can now be accessed using ``SUITS``, ``FACES``, and ``NUMBERS``.
- Moved ``Deck.check_term`` out of ``Deck``, and into the global scope. It can now be accessed by calling ``check_term``.

Features
^^^^^^^^

- Added some magic methods to the ``Card``, and ``Deck`` objects.
    - Added to ``Card``:
        - ``__eq__``
        - ``__gt__``
        - ``__hash__``
        - ``__repr__``
        - ``__str__``
    - Added to ``Deck``:  
        - ``__add__``
        - ``__contains__``
        - ``__delitem__``
        - ``__eq__``
        - ``__getitem__``
        - ``__iter__``
        - ``__len__``
        - ``__repr__``
        - ``__setitem__``
        - ``__str__``
- Added a few global constants, for use with some common card games:
    - ``POKER_RANKS``, which is a dict of poker ranks.
        - This is also used by ``Card.__gt__``.
    - ``BIG2_RANKS``, which is a dict of ranks for the game Big Two (Deuces).
    - ``BLACKJACK_VALS``, which is a dict of card values for Black Jack (Twenty One).
- ``Deck.peek``, in addition to accepting a single deck indice for an argument, can now accept a list of deck indices as well.
- ``Deck.get``, in addition to accepting card names/values/suits/abbrevs. as an argument, can now accept deck indices as well.
