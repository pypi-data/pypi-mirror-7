PyDealer: Playing Card Package
==============================

A simple package for constructing ``Deck`` instances, of 52 common 
playing cards. Each card is a separate ``Card`` instance, with a name, value, 
suit, and abbreviation. Could possibly be used for a CLI card-based game, or even a graphical game as well, I suppose.
