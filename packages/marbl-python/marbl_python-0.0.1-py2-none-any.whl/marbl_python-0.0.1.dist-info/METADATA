============
Marbl-Python
============

Marbl-Python is a Python implementation of the
`Marbl specification <https://github.com/wmayner/marbl>`_
for normalized representations of Markov blankets in Bayesian networks.

It provides objects and methods for serializing and hashing **Marbls** (Markov
blankets normalized per the Marbl spec), and unordered collections of them.
