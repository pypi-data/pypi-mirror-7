title: Lazy Markdown Links
status: draft
slug: lazy-markdown-links

This is my text and [this is my link][*]. I'll define
the url for that link under the paragraph.

I can use [multiple][*] lazy links in [a paragraph][*],
and then just define them in order below it.

I can also use lazy links when there are already [existing
numbered links][1] in [the text][3].
