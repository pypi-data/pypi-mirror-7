Overview
--------
Travel time calculation tool for ObsPy.

The obspy.taup package contains Python wrappers for iaspei-tau - a travel time
library by Arthur Snoke (http://www.iris.edu/software/downloads/processing/).
The library iaspei-tau is written in Fortran and interfaced via Python ctypes.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
