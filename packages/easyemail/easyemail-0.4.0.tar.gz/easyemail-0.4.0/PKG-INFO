Description: easyemail
        =========
        
        Small lib abstracting creation and sending emails with smtplib. This is work in
        progress, please do not use it in production.
        
        WARNING
        -------
        
        From version 0.3 and up I stopped supporting template rendering inside of the
        library. Now you need to render html / text on your side and use attach_text.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with pip::
        
            $ pip install easyemail
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run tests, you'll need `mako` and `jinja2` libraries that are not included
        in requirements in normal setup.
        
        You can run tests that way::
        
            $ python setup.py test
