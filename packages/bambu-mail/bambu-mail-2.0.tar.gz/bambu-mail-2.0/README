Bambu Mail
==========

A shortcut function for sending template-based emails in HTML and
plain-text format, and subscribing users to newsletters

About Bambu Mail
----------------

This package allows for the quick and simple sending of emails in both
plain-text and HTML format, without needing to specify both. A base HTML
template is supplied which can be overridden. Markdown is the expected
format for the email body, which means it gets transformed into HTML but
left alone for the text-only version.

In addition, Bambu Mail has a simple provider system for newsletter
subscriptions, allowing new signups to be automatically added to a
mailing list (should they choose to). The only current provider in this
package is for Mailchimp, but the base type is easily extensible.

Finally, Bambu Mail provides a Postmark email backend, based on the
`django-postmark <https://github.com/dstufft/django-postmark>`_ but with
a slight bug fix.

About Bambu Tools 2.0
---------------------

This is part of a toolset called Bambu Tools. It's being moved from a
namespace of ``bambu`` to its own 'root-level' package, along with all
the other tools in the set. If you're upgrading from a version prior to
2.0, please make sure to update your code to use ``bambu_mail`` rather
than ``bambu.mail``.

Installation
------------

Install the package via Pip:

::

    pip install bambu-mail

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list along with Bambu Markup:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...

    )
