0.1.2

* Breaking changes: ``cache_factory`` keyword arguments ``depends_on`` is a
  list of callables which receiving request as only argument. Callables return
  the dependency to be identified by cache manager.
* Add arguments ``predicates`` to ``cache_factory`` which permits to add
  predicates to cache key used for the view (useful for query strings).

0.1

* First draft of interfaces
* Add a highly not efficient implementation of a key versioner
* Add a model versioner which depends on key versioner and model identity
  inspector
* Add an example application with dummy sqla model to run tests against
* Add an sqla specific extention with hook on session events to get model
  modifications.
* Add and remove `cache_basic`Â decorator to cache basic function with primitive
  typed argument. Let's focus at view level. We'll do basic decoraor later.
* Add `cache_factory` to construct a decorator to pass to `config.add_view`
  method.
* Add a cache manager which plug all components.
* Add serializers to adapt objects to store on cache. Serializer objects follow
  a standard `loads`/`dumps` interface.
* Add Redis client for caching and versioning
* Implement master-version in redis version-store
* The cache manager emits CacheHit and CacheMiss events. These events can be
  forwarded to a statistics aggregator by using the pyramid_metrics extension.
* Sets the reponse ETag and custom X-View-Cache HTTP headers based on the
  versioned key of the resource.
