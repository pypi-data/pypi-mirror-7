Publish

publish is a general feature publishing tool for projects written in python.
It's current features are the ability to write over license files
automatically update itself to the pypy repository.

Future versions should hopefully contain the ability to quick-add to
repositories as well as other tools.

Syntax
    publish [directory] [--options[ word]]

publish [directory]
    - updates license and first line of all files in directory
    - if directory is left out, the working directory is used.

publish file
    - same as above but for a single file
