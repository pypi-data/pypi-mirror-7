Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is the recipe that will build the CellML API Python bindings with
        all options enabled by default.  Currently, there are some limitations,
        such as all dependencies required to build the CellML API must be
        installed before this recipe can be used, and I don't think this will
        work under Windows at the moment.
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        api-version
            CellML API version to build.  Valid versions any versions that build
            via CMake and has Python bindings (>1.10), and must be present in
            the list of valid versions.
        
        cmake-generator
            The generator to use.  Only the default option ``Unix Makefiles`` is
            supported, as this recipe is built on top of ``zc.recipe.cmmi`` 
            which will make use of ``make`` and ``make install``.
        
        check-build
            Whether to check build time dependencies.  Default is off because it
            didn't detect GSL libraries even though it was installed for me.
            Same as passing ``-DCHECK_BUILD:BOOL=OFF`` to ``cmake``.
        
        Other supported options:
        
            - enable-examples
            - enable-annotools
            - enable-ccgs
            - enable-celeds
            - enable-celeds-exporter
            - enable-cevas
            - enable-cis
            - enable-cuses
            - enable-gsl-integrators
            - enable-malaes
            - enable-python
            - enable-rdf
            - enable-spros
            - enable-srus
            - enable-telicems
            - enable-vacss
        
        Please refer to the `CellML API Documentations`_ for what these options
        do.

        Usage
        =====
        
        As this egg is published on `pypi`_, this recipe can be used right away
        by including a new part inside a ``buildout.cfg``.  The following is an
        example configuration:
        
        .. _pypi: http://pypi.python.org/
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = 
                ...
                cellml-api
                cellmlpy
        
            [cellml-api]
            recipe = cellml.recipe.api
            api-version = 1.10   
        
            [cellmlpy]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = 
            interpreter = cellmlpy
            scripts = cellmlpy
            extra-paths = ${cellml-api:location}/lib/python
        
        This example ``buildout.cfg`` will build the CellML API v1.10 with all
        the supported options enabled, and a script will be generated in
        ``bin/cellmlpy`` which will allow the bindings to be imported without
        setting ``PYTHONPATH`` and other related environmental variables.
        Please refer to the examples directory for more detailed instructions
        and other example usages of this recipe.

          empty string even if unassigned; this caused various unwanted side
          effects.
        - Fixed the issue where the location of this buildout recipe is 
          undefined.

        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        Demonstration
        =============
        
        This recipe extends on the ``zc.recipe.cmmi`` with the caveat where
        cmake is called instead of the ``./configure`` scripts, yet have cmake
        generate ``Unix Makefiles`` such that the ``make``/``make install`` that
        cmmi calls will proceed as normal.
        
        For the demonstration, instead of download/building the entire API, we
        are going to make use of the mock-ups (which is previous setup).
        ::
        
            >>> ls(distros)
            -  cellml-api-0.0fake.tgz
        
            >>> distros_url = start_server(distros)
            >>> archive_url = '%scellml-api-0.0fake.tgz' % distros_url
        
        Let's create our buildout, but modified so that we use our fake archive.
        ::
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... parts = cellml-api
            ...
            ... [cellml-api]
            ... recipe = cellml.recipe.api
            ... api-version = 0.0fake
            ... """)
        
        As our mocked up api version is not listed as an available version, 
        buildout will die.
        ::
        
            >>> print 'start', system(buildout)
            start...
              Installing.
              Getting section cellml-api.
              Initializing part cellml-api.
            ...
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: api-version `0.0fake` is not a supported version of...
            <BLANKLINE>
        
        Well, since our fake version is obviously not going to be added into the
        listing of supported APIs, we can still provide our url and md5sum, as
        the original function provided by ``zc.recipe.cmmi`` is still in effect.
        Rewrite buildout.cfg with the desired attributes.
        ::
        
            >>> try: from hashlib import md5
            ... except ImportError: from md5 import new as md5
            >>> m = md5(open(join(distros, 'cellml-api-0.0fake.tgz')
            ...             ).read()).hexdigest()
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... parts = cellml-api
            ...
            ... [cellml-api]
            ... recipe = cellml.recipe.api
            ... url = %s
            ... md5sum = %s
            ... """ % (archive_url, m))
        
            >>> print 'start', system(buildout)
            start...
