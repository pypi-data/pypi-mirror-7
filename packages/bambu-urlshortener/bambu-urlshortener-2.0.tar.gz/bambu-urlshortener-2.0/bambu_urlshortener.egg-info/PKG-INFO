Description: Bambu URL Shortener
        ===================
        
        This package generates short URLs when given longer ones. These can be
        generated by the app, with a 7 (by default) character short-name, or by
        an external provider, like bit.ly.
        
        About Bambu Tools 2.0
        ---------------------
        
        This is part of a toolset called Bambu Tools. It's being moved from a
        namespace of ``bambu`` to its own 'root-level' package, along with all
        the other tools in the set. If you're upgrading from a version prior to
        2.0, please make sure to update your code to use ``bambu_urlshortener``
        rather than ``bambu.urlshortener``.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the package via Pip:
        
        ::
        
            pip install bambu-urlshortener
        
        Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'bambu_urlshortener'
            )
        
        To use internal URL shortening - rather than a service like bit.ly - add
        the middleware to your settings:
        
        ::
        
            MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
                ...
                'bambu_urlshortener.middleware.ShortURLFallbackMiddleware'
            )
        
        This should be added as close to the end of your middleware list as
        possible, as it looks for 404 responses and tries to find a URL
        short-name corresponding to the requested path.
        
        Run ``manage.py syncdb`` or ``manage.py migrate`` to setup the database
        tables.
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        Simply call ``bambu_urlshortener.shorten``, passing in the long URL.
        
        Providers
        ---------
        
        There are two in-built shortening providers:
        
        ``bambu_urlshortener.providers.db.DatabaseProvider``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This default option, coupled with the middleware allows a web app to
        provide its own short URLs.
        
        ``bambu_urlshortener.providers.bitly.BitlyProvider``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Calls the bit.ly API and returns a short URL. Specify the API key via
        the ``SHORTURL_TOKEN`` setting. Optionally set the ``SHORTURL_DOMAIN``
        setting if you want to use a custom domain name.
