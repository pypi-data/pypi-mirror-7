# This is an example of how to get lossless reload of WSGI web servers with
# circus and uWSGI. You will, of course, need to specify the web app you
# need for uWSGI to run.
#
# This example also solves another problem I have faced many times with uWSGI.
# When you start an app with a defect in uWSGI, uWSGI will keep restarting
# if forever. So this example includes an after_spawn hook that does flapping
# detection on the uWSGI workers.
#
# Here is the flow for a reload:
# 1. You issue a reload command to the watcher
# 2. The watcher starts a new instance of uWSGI
# 3. The after_spawn hook ensures that the workers are not flapping and halts
#    the new process if it is, aborting the reload. This would leave the old
#    process running so that you are not just SOL.
# 4. The watcher issues SIGQUIT to the old instance, which is intercepted by
#    the before_signal hook
# 5. We send SIGTSTP to the old process to tell uWSGI to stop receiving new
#    connections
# 6. We query the stats from the old process in a loop waiting for the old
#    workers to go to the pause state
# 7. We return True, allowing the SIGQUIT to be issued to the old process
