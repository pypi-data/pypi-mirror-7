1.0.0
- Major internal rewrite:
-- gives spec2scl ability to recognize specfile sections and apply certain transforms
   only in certain sections.
-- Transformers are now independent of the specfile they convert, which improves
   testability and makes it easy to use spec2scl as a library.
- spec2scl now runs on Python 3.
- Killed endless loop on generic transformer (thanks Mirek Suchy for reporting).
- Commented commands now don't get sclized (thanks Mirek Suchy for reporting).
- Various fixes for Ruby transformer (thanks Mirek Suchy for reporting).

- Improve handling of multiline commands.
- Improve Ruby transformer to handle "ruby" execution (still needs some attention, though).
