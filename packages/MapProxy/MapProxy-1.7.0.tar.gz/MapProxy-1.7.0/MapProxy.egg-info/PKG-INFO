        MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.
        
        MapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.
