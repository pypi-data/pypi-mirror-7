Description: ========
        Pandarus
        ========
        
        Pandarus is software for taking two geospatial data sets (either raster or vector), and calculating their combined intersected areas. Here is an example of two input maps, one in blue, the other in red:
        
        .. image:: http://mutel.org/map.png
           :width: 457
           :height: 454
        
        Pandarus would calculate the intersected areas of each spatial unit of both maps, and output the following:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            {(0, 0): 0.25,
             (0, 1): 0.25,
             (0, 3): 0.25,
             (0, 4): 0.25,
             (1, 1): 0.25,
             (1, 2): 0.25,
             (1, 4): 0.25,
             (1, 5): 0.25,
             (2, 3): 0.25,
             (2, 4): 0.25,
             (2, 6): 0.25,
             (2, 7): 0.25,
             (3, 4): 0.25,
             (3, 5): 0.25,
             (3, 7): 0.25,
             (3, 8): 0.25}
