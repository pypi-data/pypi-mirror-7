        Tallywallet helps Engineers understand Money and Banking.
        
        You can use it to create economic simulations, or to enable your applications
        with currency exchange and accounting features.
        
        This package
        ::::::::::::
        
        Tallywallet is a very young project. This package implements the following:
        
        * A Ledger class for double-entry accounting
        * An Exchange class to enable currency trading
        * `Pre-hoc` calculation of exchange rate gains on currency trading accounts
        * Evaluation of the Fundamental Accounting Equation to verify balanced accounts
        * A text format for saving Ledgers to file
        * A tutorial on how to achieve foreign currency exchange in Python code
        * An example of a macroeconomic monetary circuit simulation
        
        Requirements
        ::::::::::::
        
        Tallywallet requires Python 3.4. It uses setuptools_ for installation, but
        normally it has no external runtime dependencies.
        
        You may have to `compile Python 3.4`_ yourself if it is not yet available from
        your package repository.
        
        Tallywallet comes with unit tests. To run them all requires the RSON_ package.
        
        Quick start
        :::::::::::
        
        Download and unpack the source distribution::
        
            $ tar -xzvf tallywallet-common-0.007.tar.gz
            $ cd tallywallet-common-0.007
        
        Run the tests::
        
            $ python3.4 -m unittest discover tallywallet
        
        Consult the documentation::
        
            $ firefox tallywallet/common/doc/html/index.html
        
        Roadmap
        :::::::
        
        Tallywallet's mission is to provide a validated Pythonic framework for money
        trading and economic applications.
        
        It is developed by a private individual but released to the public under the
        `GNU Affero General Public License`_.
        
        The API may change significantly as the project proceeds. At this early stage,
        you should only use the latest release, which may not be compatible with
        previous versions.
        
        Next release
        ============
        
        The next release will provide an example of a macro-economic simulation using
        balanced accounting methods.
        
        Can you help?
        =============
