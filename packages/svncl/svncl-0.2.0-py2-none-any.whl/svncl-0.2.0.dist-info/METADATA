Introduction
------------

A tool to generate a change log from the commits occurring after the last tag. 
This is intended to simplify creating tag commit-messages. Messages are 
generated starting from the oldest.

I'm no more a fan of SVN than the next, modern developer, but it still exists.
If I have to use it, I'm going to make it as painless as possible.


Usage
-----

To generate a changelog:

```
$ svncl . https://svnserver.com/tags/project
- Setup fix.
- Removed obsolete references to collections package.
- Updates are now stored in S3.
- Added parallel S3 downloading.
```

This represents the four commits that have occurred since the last tag/release.

To do a release and simply pipe the output of *svncl* into the commit-message:

```
$ svncl . https://svnserver.com/tags/project1 | svn cp -F - https://svnserver.com/trunk/project1 https://svnserver.com/tags/project1/project1-1.4.4 

Committed revision 767.

$ svn log -l 1 https://svnserver.com/tags/project1
