Description: 
        This ephemeris has been the basis for the Astronomical Almanac of the
        United States Naval Observatory since 2003 and powers the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory's online HORIZONS service. Coordinates and velocities are
        provided for the major planets, the Sun, and Earth's Moon.

        The accuracy of this ephemeris is good; the position of the Earth or
        Mars, for example, should be accurate to within 2 km.  But the more
        recent `DE421 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de421>`_ ephemeris provides
        greater accuracy, especially with respect to the Moon, and you should
        use it instead if you are planning a space mission.  For missions to
        Mercury or Venus, `DE423 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de421>`_ will be
        an even better choice.
        
        See `DE406 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de406>`_ if you are interested
        in a similar ephemeris for dates far in the past or future, or `DE422
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/de422>`_ if you want high accuracy over a
        long time period (and have enough disk space).
        
        To compute using this ephemeris in Python, see the `jplephem
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jplephem>`_ package.
