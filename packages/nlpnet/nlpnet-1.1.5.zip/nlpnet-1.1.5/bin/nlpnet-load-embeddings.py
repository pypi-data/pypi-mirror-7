This script can deal with the following formats:
    
    plain - a plain text file containing one vector per line

        It should NOT include special tokens for padding or 
        unknown words.
        
    senna - the one used by the SENNA system by Ronan Collobert.
        Same as plain, except it includes special words PADDING

    gensim - a file format saved by the gensim library. It doesn't

    word2embeddings - format used by the neural language model from
        word2embeddings (used in polyglot).
