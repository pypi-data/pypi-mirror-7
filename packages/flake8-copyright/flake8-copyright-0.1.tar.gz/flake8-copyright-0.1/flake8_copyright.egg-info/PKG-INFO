Description: Flake8 Copyright plugin
        =======================
        
        Checks for copyright notices in all python files. It runs a simple regular expression search for
        strings like::
        
            Copyright 2014 <author>
            Copyright (C) 2014 <author>
        
        ``<author>`` can be anything unless you specify it with the ``copyright-author`` option (see below).
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install with pip::
        
            pip install flake8-copyright
        
        Then, activate copyright checks in your flake8 configuration with::
        
            copyright-check = True
        
        Further options
        ---------------
        
        copyright-min-file-size
            Minimum number of characters in a file before requiring a copyright notice. This is to avoid
            forcing yourself to add copyright notices to very small or empty files. Default: ``0``.
        
        copyright-author
            Checks for a specific author in the copyright notice.
        
        copyright-regexp
            If you're not happy with the regexp that is ran to look for copyright notices, you can change it
            with this option. Default: ``Copyright\s+(\(C\)\s+)?\d{4}\s+%(author)s``. ``%(author)s`` is
            replaced by the contents of ``copyright-author``.
