js.autobahn
***********

Introduction
============

This library packages `Autobahn|JS`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Autobahn|JS`: http://autobahn.ws/js/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.autobahn``) are published to some URL.
