Description: Hamper
        ====
        A CLI for the iOS Provisioning Portal. Fix the broken part of your iOS development workflow.
        
        The end goal for hamper is to have one command line utlity to manage your certificates, provisioning profiles and app IDs. It's a work in progress...
        
        ### Under the hood
        Hamper uses [Selenium (with Python bindings)](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/installation.html) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) to go through the provisioning portal and execute requests. We're using [docopt](http://docopt.org/) to build the actual CLI and [termcolor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor) to log messages to the console. Thus, these four libraries are required for running Hamper. I'll add a requirements.txt for the v1.0 release.
