        This package includes a content type, views and viewlets to represent a blog

        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.blog`` to the list of eggs to
           install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                sc.blog
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``sc.blog`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
            in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Usage
        ^^^^^
        
        Just install the package and start adding Blogs and Posts.
        
        A blog may have an associated image that is shown in a viewlet located below
        the breadcrumb.
        
        TODO List
        ^^^^^^^^^
        
        * Navigation portlet listing posts on chronological order (refs. `#4`_)
        * Tag Cloud portlet listing tags in posts (refs. `#6`_)
        
        Not entirely unlike
        -------------------
        
        `blog.star`_
            A suite of blogging modules for Plone. It is primarily designed for
            integrators. Most people who use Plone for blogging also uses Plone as a
            customized content management system, and they have specific requirements
            and their own skin, custom content types and other integrations. It turned
            out that other Plone blogging products make a lot of assumption about how
            you are to use it, what you want from a blog, and how your site is set up.
        
        
        `ftw.blog`_
            ftw.blog provides a blog implementation for Plone featuring tags and
            categories. A user can add a new blog entry and tag it using tags and
            categories. Available categories are defined by the creator of the blog,
            whilst tags can be added freely by the author of a blog entry. Blog
            entries are listed in chronological order, in a tag cloud, by categories,
            and in a monthly archive. Entries can be searched by using the search
            function of the blog.
        
        `Scrawl`_
            A dirt-simple blog product for Plone. It copies the News Item content type
            to create a Blog Entry (with a slightly tweaked view template) and adds an
            alternative view to Collections (blog_view). Note that blog_view shows
            either the description of each contained blog entry (if it exists) or the
            entire body. It's up to the user to limit those results in an intelligent
            way so that page loads doesn't take too long.
