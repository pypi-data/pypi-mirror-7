Description: pyramid_pluggable_session
        =========================
        
        Want to be able to change out session backends using a simple configuration
        change, want to store your session data in a new location but re-implementing
        ISession from Pyramid looks too daunting, fear not, pyramid_pluggable_session
        makes this really simple.
        
        Is this a pyramid_beaker replacement?
        =====================================
        
        Yes. Although I've already been told that unless I implement ALL existing
        beaker backends that I am not doing it right, so I am hereby doing it wrong
        ;-).
        
        Pull requests
        =============
        
        Want to add a new backend? Perfect. Want to write some tests? Documentation?
        The whole nine yards? Please!
        
        1. Clone this repo, create a new topic branch, and hack hack hack.
        2. Push your topic branch to Github
        3. Create a new pull request
        4. I will review it, and if all is well pull it into this source tree!

        =======
        
        - Add better protection against session fixation:
            - Upon failure to deserialize/unpack/expiration of session a new session id
              is generated.
            - Upon calling invalidate() a new session is generated with a new session
              id
        
        - Add more clean-up using the new clear() functionality. When a session fails
          to deserialize, we remove it from the backends, if a session fails to unpack
          we remove it from the backends, and if it has expired we also remove it from
          the backends.
        
        - Update the included backends memory/file/chain to add the new clear()
          function required by IPlugSession.
        
        - Add clear() to IPlugSession interface to allow the session to explicitly have
          the backend plugs remove the session data associated with a certain session
          id.
        
        - On _save_session we set the cookie to response that is provided to us by the
          callback, and not request.response which may not be the users response.
        
        0.0.0a1
        =======
        
        New features:
        
        - A file based session storage now exists.
        
        - A chain can now be constructed for session storage
        
        0.0.0dev
        ========
        
        - A new ISession compliant Pyramid session provider appears.
        
        - A single backend exists, it is based on local Pyramid memory.
