v2
--

`v2 branch <https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light/tree/v2>`_ is
under active development.

You might want to use that instead, since it's much easier to work with and
supports python3.

In this case, please refer to the `v2 documentation
<http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/v2/>`_.

**To upgrade to v2**, inherit from `autocomplete_light.ModelForm` and remove
calls to `get_widgets_dict`. Optionnaly remove all old widget definitions.
