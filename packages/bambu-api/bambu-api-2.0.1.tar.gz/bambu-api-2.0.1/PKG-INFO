Description: Bambu API
        =========
        
        Quickly expose your models to a JSON or XML API, authenticated via HTTP
        or OAuth.
        
        About Bambu API
        ---------------
        
        This package allows you to easily expose Django models to RESTful
        endpoints which can send data in XML or JSON format.
        
        About Bambu Tools 2.0
        ---------------------
        
        This is part of a toolset called Bambu Tools. It's being moved from a
        namespace of ``bambu`` to its own 'root-level' package, along with all
        the other tools in the set. If you're upgrading from a version prior to
        2.0, please make sure to update your code to use ``bambu_api`` rather
        than ``bambu.api``.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the package via Pip:
        
        ::
        
            pip install bambu-api
        
        Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'bambu_api'
            )
        
        Add ``bambu_api.urls`` to your URLconf:
        
        ::
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...
                url(r'^', include('bambu_api.urls')),
            )
        
        The prefix should be kept blank, as the package exposes two main URL
        stems: ``/api/``, wherein the RESTful endpoints live, and ``/docs/``
        where auto-generated documentation for each endpoint is found.
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        You define API endpoints like Django admins, and register them in a
        similar way.
        
        Teka the Django 'polls' app as an example. Within the polls directory,
        you'd create a file called api.py. A simple API endpoint would be
        defined like this:
        
        ::
        
            from bambu_api import ModelAPI, site
            from myproject.polls.models import Question
        
            class QuestionAPI(ModelAPI):
                pass
        
            site.register(Question, QuestionAPI)
        
        This registers the ``QuestionAPI`` endpoint for the ``Question`` model.
        The endpoint is then accessible at ``/api/polls/question.json``.
