Pyomo Model Components:
----------------------------------------------------------------

 AbstractModel
    An abstract optimization model that defers construction of
    components.

 BuildAction
    This component is used to inject arbitrary actions into the
    model construction process.  The action rule is applied to
    every index value.

 BuildCheck
    This component is used to perform a test during the model
    construction process.  The action rule is applied to every
    index value, and if the function returns False an exception
    is raised.

 ConcreteModel
    A concrete optimization model that does not defer
    construction of components.

 Connector
    A bundle of variables that can be manipilated together.

 Constraint
    Constraint expressions in a model.

 ConstraintList
    A list of constraints in a model.

 Expression
    A container for shared expression data.

 Model
    Model objects can be used as a component of other models.

 Objective
    Expressions that are minimized or maximized in a model.

 ObjectiveList
    A list of objectives in a model.

 Param
    Parameter data that is used to define a model instance.

 Piecewise
    A generator of piecewise constraints.

 RangeSet
    A sequence of numeric values.  RangeSet(start,end,step) is
    a sequence starting a value 'start', and increasing in
    values by 'step' until a value greater than or equal to
    'end' is reached.

 SOSConstraint
    SOS constraint expressions in a model.

 Set
    Set data that is used to define a model instance.

 SetOf
    Define a Pyomo Set component using an iterable data object.

 Suffix
    Extraneous model data

 Var
    Decision variables in a model.

 VarList
    Variable-length list of decision variables in a model.
