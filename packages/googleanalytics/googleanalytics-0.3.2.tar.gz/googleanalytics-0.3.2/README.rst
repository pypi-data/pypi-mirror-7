``python-google-analytics`` provides a light wrapper on top of Google's
own Google Analytics API client for Python. It also includes a
minimalistic command-line interface to explore your account.

-  **Authentication.** OAuth2 is a bit of a pain and we've made it
   easier.
-  **Querying.** Easier to query per week, month or year. Query using
   metric IDs or using their full names, whichever you think is nicer.
   Work with both the Core and the Live APIs.
-  **Reporting.** Iterate through the entire report or
   column-per-column.
-  **Exploration.** Traverse the account hierarchy from account to
   webproperty to profile to dimensions, both programmatically and with
   the included command-line interface.

Authentication
--------------

The newest Google Analytics API, v3, only supports authentication using
OAuth2. It won't work with your account username and password. There's a
few steps to get started.

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/project and create a new
   project. This registers your application with Google.
2. Click on your project, go to ``APIs & auth`` and then
   ``Credentials``.
3. Find your Client ID and Client secret. Optionally, add these to your
   environment variables, e.g. by adding
   ``export GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_ID=...`` (and so on) to your
   ``~/.bashrc``

Now we're ready to authenticate. If you've put the client secrets in the
environment, you can use these environment variables to authenticate:

::

    import os
    import googleanalytics as ga
    accounts = ga.oauth.ask_and_authenticate(os.environ)

``accounts`` is a list of user accounts that your credentials have given
you access to.

If you didn't add the client secrets to your environment variables, you
can also just pass them directly from your code:

::

    import googleanalytics as ga
    client = dict(
        client_id='myproj.apps.googleusercontent.com', 
        client_secret='mysecret'
    )
    accounts = ga.oauth.ask_and_authenticate(**client)

Storing credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to store the OAuth2 tokens so you don't have to ask for
permission every time you run your code, you can first request tokens
and only later use them to authenticate, allowing you to save those
tokens for later use. Here's one way that could work:

::

    import googleanalytics as ga
    client = dict(
        client_id='myproj.apps.googleusercontent.com', 
        client_secret='mysecret'
    )

    if os.path.exists('tokens.json'):
        tokens = json.load(open('tokens.json'))
    else:
        tokens = ga.oauth.ask(**client)
        json.dump(tokens, open('tokens.json', 'w'), indent=4)

    accounts = ga.oauth.authenticate(**tokens)

Querying
--------

The querying interface currently looks like this.

::

    account = accounts[0]
    webproperty = account.webproperties[0]
    profile = webproperty.profiles[0]

    print account.metrics
    print account.dimensions
    print account.metrics['pageviews'] == account.metrics['ga:pageviews']

    q = profile.query('pageviews').range('2014-06-01', days=5)
    report = q.execute()
    print report['pageviews']

CLI
---

``python-google-analytics`` comes with a small command-line interface
through the ``gash`` command. Use ``--help`` to find out more about how
it works.

The command-line interface currently comes with three subcommands:

-  ``auth``: get a Google Analytics OAuth token, given a client id and
   secret (provided as arguments, or procured from the environment)
-  ``revoke``: revoke existing authentication, useful for debugging or
   when your existing tokens for some reason don't work anymore
-  ``ls``: explore your account

auth
----

You may specify the ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` on the
commandline, optionally prefaced with a short and more easily-remembered
name for this client.

If no ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` are specified, these will be
fetched from your environment variables, by default these are in
``GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_ID`` and ``GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_SECRET``
but you may specify a suffix as the first argument to this command.

::

    # look in environment variables
    gash auth

    # look in `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_ID_B` 
    # and `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_SECRET_B`
    # environment variables
    gash auth b

    # specify client information on the command line
    gash auth myid mysecret

    # optionally specify a more readable client name 
    # for later reference
    gash auth mynick myid mysecret

revoke
------

::

    gash revoke <name>

ls
--

::

    # show all of your accounts
    gash ls myproj
    # show all of the web properties for an account
    gash ls myproj myacc
    # show all of the profiles for a web property
    gash ls myproj myacc myprop
    # show all of the columns (metrics and dimensions) for a profile
    gash ls myproj myacc myprop myprof
    gash ls myproj . . .
    # find all metrics and dimensions that have "queried" in their name
    gash ls myproj myacc . . queried
