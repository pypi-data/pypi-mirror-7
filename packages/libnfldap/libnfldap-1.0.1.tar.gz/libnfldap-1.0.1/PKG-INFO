Description: =========
        libnfldap
        =========
        
        A Python module to generate IPTables and IPSet rules from LDAP records.
        See example.py for a demo.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The script at `example_allusers.py` will build iptables and ipset rules for all
        users in LDAP. You can provide the script an ldap filter as argv[1] to limit the
        scope.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
        	$ time python example_allusers.py '(uid=jvehent)'
        	IPTables rules written in /tmp/tmpT7JgOW
        	IPSet rules written in /tmp/tmpJYtWM5
        
        	real    0m0.605s
        	user    0m0.061s
        	sys     0m0.014s
        
        `example.py` does something similar but for a single user identified by its
        uidNumber (unix user ID).
        
        .. code:: bash
        
        	$ python example.py 2297
        	#Generating rules for user ID 1664
        	#====== ACL details ======
        	jvehent has access to .....
