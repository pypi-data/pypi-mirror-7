libnfldap
=========

A Python module to generate IPTables and IPSet rules from LDAP records.
See example.py for a demo.

Installation
------------

Use PyPi:

.. code:: bash

	$ sudo pip install libnfldap

Or build a RPM using:

.. code:: bash

	$ python setup.py bdist_rpm

The later will require `python-ldap` to be installed separately, either using
`yum install python-ldap` or `pip install ldap`. It's up to you, the RPM will
not attempt to install the ldap dependency.

Example
-------

The script at `example_allusers.py` will build iptables and ipset rules for all
users in LDAP. You can provide the script an ldap filter as argv[1] to limit the
scope.

.. code:: bash

	$ time python example_allusers.py '(uid=jvehent)'
	IPTables rules written in /tmp/tmpT7JgOW
	IPSet rules written in /tmp/tmpJYtWM5

	real    0m0.605s
	user    0m0.061s
	sys     0m0.014s

`example.py` does something similar but for a single user identified by its
uidNumber (unix user ID).

.. code:: bash

	$ python example.py 2297
	#Generating rules for user ID 1664
	#====== ACL details ======
	jvehent has access to .....
