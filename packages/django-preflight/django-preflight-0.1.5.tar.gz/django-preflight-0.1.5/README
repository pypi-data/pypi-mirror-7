Django Pre-flight
=================

Overview
========

Django Pre-flight is meant to help with creation of simple pages on
which one can quickly gauge health of the system and its external
dependencies. It's a great help for testers before actually delving
into the system to be sure that all is configured correctly and any
found problems are due to bugs in the code itself and not because of
misconfiguration.

This project provides framework for creating set of checks (methods)
which determine the health of the system, a way of executing all of
them and gathering the results. You can either see the result via the
web interface or using Django's ``manage.py`` command.

Additionally the web page displays the versions of various system
components, like Python, Django, django-preflight itself. This
versions list also have a way of extending it to include project's
specific bits of information.

More information can be found in ``doc/`` directory.


Testing
=======

To run tests just invoke tox_ command. If you don't have it installed
you can use supplied ``tox`` script which will pull it automatically
and then run the whole test suite.
