Description: =================
        Django Pre-flight
        =================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Django Pre-flight is meant to help with creation of simple pages on
        which one can quickly gauge health of the system and its external
        dependencies. It's a great help for testers before actually delving
        into the system to be sure that all is configured correctly and any
        found problems are due to bugs in the code itself and not because of
        misconfiguration.
        
        This project provides framework for creating set of checks (methods)
        which determine the health of the system, a way of executing all of
        them and gathering the results. You can either see the result via the
        web interface or using Django's ``manage.py`` command.
        
        Additionally the web page displays the versions of various system
        components, like Python, Django, django-preflight itself. This
        versions list also have a way of extending it to include project's
        specific bits of information.
        
        More information can be found in ``doc/`` directory.
        
        
        Testing
