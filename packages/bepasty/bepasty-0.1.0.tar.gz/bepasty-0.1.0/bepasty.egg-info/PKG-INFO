Description: bepasty
        =======
        
        bepasty is like a pastebin for all kinds of files (text, image, audio, video,
        documents, ..., binary).
        
        The documentation is there:
        http://bepasty-server.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Generic:
        
          - you can upload multiple files at once, simply by drag and drop
          - after upload, you get a unique link to a view of each file
          - on that view, we offer:
        
            + download link
            + upload time (UTC)
            + file name we stored at upload time
            + file type we detected at upload time
            + precise size we computed at upload time
            + SHA256 hash ("checksum")
        
          - if you uploaded multiple files, you can create a pastebin with the list
            of all these files - with a single click!
        
        * Text files:
        
          - we highlight all text file types supported by pygments (a lot!)
          - we display line numbers
          - we link from line numbers to their anchors, so you can easily get a link
            to a specific line
        
        * Image files:
        
          - we show the image (format support depends on browser)
        
        * Audio and video files:
        
          - we show the html5 player for it (format support depends on browser)
        
        * PDFs:
        
          - we support rendering PDFs in your browser (if your browser is able to)
        
        * Storage: we use a storage backend api, currently we have backends for:
        
          - filesystem storage (just use a filesystem directory to store
            <uuid>.meta and <uuid>.data files)
          - ceph cluster storage (distributed & fault-tolerant - uses RADOS Block
            Devices via librbd and librados)
        
        * Keeping some control:
        
          - flexible permissions: create, read, delete, admin
          - assign permissions to users of login secrets
          - assign default permissions to not-logged-in users
          - you can purge files from storage by age, inactivity, size, type, ...
