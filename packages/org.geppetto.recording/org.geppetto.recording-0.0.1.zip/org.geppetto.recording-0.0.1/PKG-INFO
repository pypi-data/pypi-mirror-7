        This Python project creates recordings for `Geppetto <www.geppetto.org>`_.
        A recording is a file that contains all the raw data processed during a simulation run.
        The recording files are based on the popular binary file format `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_
        (more information to come).
