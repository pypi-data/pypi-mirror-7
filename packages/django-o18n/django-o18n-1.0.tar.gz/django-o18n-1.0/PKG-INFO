Description: Use case
        --------
        
        Django's [i18n_patterns][] prefixes URLs with a language code which may
        contain a variant e.g. `/en`, `/fr`, `/fr-ca`.
        
        o18n_patterns is similar but it prefixes URLs with a country code and a
        language code e.g. `/us`, `/ca/en`, `/ca/fr`.
        
        This is useful for websites that are mainly segmented by country rather than
        by language.

        Features
        --------
        
        Some countries have a main language. In that case, the URL for the main
        language only contains the country e.g. `/us`. URLs for other languages
        contain the country and the language e.g. `/us/es`.
        
        Some countries don't have a main language â€” and it may be a sensitive topic!
        In that case, all URLs contain the country and the language e.g. `/ca/en` and
        `/ca/fr`.
        
        Unlike i18_patterns, o18n_patterns doesn't attempt to determine the country
        and language and automatically redirect the user to the appropriate URL.
        
        If an URL doesn't match a valid country and language combination, it doesn't
        resolve with o18n_patterns and no country is activated. Vice-versa, if no
        country is active, reversing an URL raises an exception.
