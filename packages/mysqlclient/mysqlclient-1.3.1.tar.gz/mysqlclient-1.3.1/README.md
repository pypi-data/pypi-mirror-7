mysqlclient
===========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python.png)](http://travis-ci.org/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python)

This is a fork of [MySQLdb1](farcepest/MySQLdb1).

This project adds Python 3 support and bug fixes.
I hope this fork is merged back to MySQLdb1 like distribute was merged back to setuptools.

TODO
----

* A 1.3.0 release that will support Python 2.7 and 3.3-3.4
* Release binary wheel for Windows.
