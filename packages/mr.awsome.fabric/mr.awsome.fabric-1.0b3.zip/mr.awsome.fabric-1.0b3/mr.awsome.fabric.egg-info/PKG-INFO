Description: Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b3 - 2014-06-09
        ------------------
        
        * When depending on Fabric, skip 1.8.3 which added a version pin on paramiko.
          [fschulze]
        
        * Only add Fabric to install_requires if it can't be imported. That way we
          don't get problems if it's already installed as a system packages or in a
          virtualenv.

        1.0b2 - 2014-05-15
        ------------------
        
        * Register ``fabfile`` massager for all instances.
          [fschulze]
        
        * Use context manager for output filtering and filter in ``do`` helper.
          [fschulze]
        
        * Moved setuptools-git from setup.py to .travis.yml, it's only needed for
          releases and testing.
