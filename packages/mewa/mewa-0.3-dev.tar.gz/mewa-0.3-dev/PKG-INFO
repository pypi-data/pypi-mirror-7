Description: # pymewa
        
        ## About
        This is Python library which simplifies connection to the [Channel Server](https://github.com/AnthillTech/mewa).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * [WebSocket client](https://github.com/liris/websocket-client)
        
        
        ## Instalation
        
        ```bash
        pip install mewa
        ```
        
        
        ## Sample usage pattern
        
        List all devices connected to the channel
        
        ```python
        connection = Connection("ws://mewa.cc/ws")
        
        def onConnected():
            connection.getDevices()
            connection.sendEvent("serviceA.event2", "78")
            connection.sendMessage("device66", "serviceA.level", "34")
        
        def onEvent(fromDevice, eventId, params):
            print("received event %s from %s with params %s" % (fromDevice, eventId, params))
        
        def onMessage(fromDevice, eventId, params):
            print("received message %s from %s with params %s" % (fromDevice, eventId, params))
            
        def onDevicesEvent(devices):
            print("Found devices:")
            print(devices)
        
            
        def onPropertyChanged(device, propertyName, value):
            print("Property %s on device %s was changed to %s" % (device, propertyName, value))
            
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            connection.onConnected = onConnected
            connection.onEvent = onEvent
            connection.onMessage = onMessage
            connection.onDevicesEvent = onDevicesEvent
            connection.connect("test", "python", "pass")
        
        
        
        ```
