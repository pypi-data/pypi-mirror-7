Description: PedeMath - A Python Vector and Math Library
        ====================================================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        PedeMath is a python vector and math library.
        
        Status - In Development
        ------
        
        It includes classes for vectors, matrices, and quaternions including<br/> 
        Vec3, Vec2, Matrix44, Rect, and Quat.
        
        Notes:<br/>
          Apis for newer classes such as Matrix44 and Quaternions are still in flux<br/>
          and in need of more unittests.<br/>
          Most classes are pure Python, but Matrix44 requires numpy for now.
