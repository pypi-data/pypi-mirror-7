PedeMath - A Python Vector and Math Library
====================================================

Introduction
------------

PedeMath is a python vector and math library.

Status - In Development
------

It includes classes for vectors, matrices, and quaternions including<br/> 
Vec3, Vec2, Matrix44, Rect, and Quat.

Notes:<br/>
  Apis for newer classes such as Matrix44 and Quaternions are still in flux<br/>
  and in need of more unittests.<br/>
  Most classes are pure Python, but Matrix44 requires numpy for now.
