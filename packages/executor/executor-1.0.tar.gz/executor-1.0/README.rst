executor: Programmer friendly subprocess wrapper
================================================

The ``execute()`` function in the ``executor`` package/module is a simple
wrapper for Python's subprocess_ module that makes it very easy to handle
subprocesses on UNIX systems with proper escaping of arguments and error
checking. For usage instructions please refer to the documentation_.

-------

The latest version of ``executor`` is available on PyPi_ and GitHub_ (although
I don't suppose much will change, since it's so simple). For bug reports please
create an issue on GitHub_. If you have questions, suggestions, etc. feel free
to send me an e-mail at `peter@peterodding.com`_.
