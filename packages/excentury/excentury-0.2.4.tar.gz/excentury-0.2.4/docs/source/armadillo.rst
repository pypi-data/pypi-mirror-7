Excentury supports the use of armadillos datatypes. Armadillo is a
C++ linear algebra library. See more information on the library at
`http://arma.sourceforge.net/ <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_.

To see an example see the following directory

> `https://github.com/jmlopez-rod/excentury/tree/master/tests <https://github.com/jmlopez-rod/excentury/tree/master/tests>`_

There we can find ``xcpp/arma.xcpp`` which contains an example. We
also need to consider the configuration file ``xcpp.config`` since it
contains information on how to compile excentury files using the
armadillo library.
