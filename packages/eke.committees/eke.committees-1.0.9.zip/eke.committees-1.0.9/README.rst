This product, ``eke.committees``, provides display and RDF ingest of committee
information into the EDRN Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to
make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's
collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers,
specimens, investigators, participants, studies, protocols, and-as in the case
of this product-committee information.

Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
Plone_ compatible site.

This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.
