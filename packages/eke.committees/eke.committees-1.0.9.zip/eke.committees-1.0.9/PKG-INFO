        **************
        
        This product, ``eke.committees``, provides display and RDF ingest of committee
        information into the EDRN Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to
        make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's
        collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers,
        specimens, investigators, participants, studies, protocols, and-as in the case
        of this product-committee information.
        
        Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
        Plone_ compatible site.
        
        This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
        operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``eke.committees`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eke.committees
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

        1.0.3 — Sitting Down
        --------------------
        
        This release updates the chair and co-chair of collaborative groups as

          name-matching "Collaborative Group" objects (from edrnsite.collaborations) in
          the portal.  You should re-ingest committees to do this re-attachment
          whenever you re-ingest sites (because the site ingest destroys People
          objects).
        * Uses the modern plone.app.testing framework.
