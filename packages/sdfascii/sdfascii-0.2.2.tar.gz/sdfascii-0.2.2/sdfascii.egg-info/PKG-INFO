        A Python (2.6+/3.3+) module for reading Standard Data Format (SDF) and
        ASCII files saved by HP/Agilent Dynamic Signal Analyzers (DSA).
        
        The HP/Agilent 35670A Dynamic Signal Analyzer has the ability to save
        files as either SDF or ASCII format.
        
        HP/Agilent DSA ASCII Format
        ---------------------------
        
        Four files are created when saving to the HP/Agilent DSA ASCII format:
        
        1. ``.HDR`` contains SDF header information
        2. ``.TXT`` contains the y-axis information, preserving the same units
           as displayed on the analyzer screen when the trace was saved
        3. ``.X`` contains the x-axis information
        4. ``.Z`` contains the z-axis information, if the trace contains
           waterfall data
        
        Source: Agilent discussion forum question `When I save the trace in the
        ASCII format, there are 4 files created with extensions of .txt, .hdr,
        .x, and .z. What are the contents of these
        files? <http://www.home.agilent.com/agilent/editorial.jspx?ckey=628664&id=628664&nid=-536902471.0.00&lc=eng&cc=IN>`__

        `sdfascii <https://github.com/questrail/sdfascii>`__ is developed using
        `Scott Chacon <http://scottchacon.com/about.html>`__'s `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__. To
        contribute, fork `sdfascii <https://github.com/questrail/sdfascii>`__,
        create a feature branch, and then submit a pull request. `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__ is
        summarized as:
        
        -  Anything in the ``master`` branch is deployable
        -  To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
           ``master`` (e.g., ``new-oauth2-scopes``)
        -  Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the
           same named branch on the server
        -  When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for
           merging, open a `pull
           request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`__.
        -  After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you
           can merge it into master.
        -  Once it is merged and pushed to ``master``, you can and *should*
           deploy immediately.
