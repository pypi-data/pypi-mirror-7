User work-flow
==============

This documentation so covers topics of installation and detailed description of
the provided API.

There is also still one topic, that needs some coverage - how the Edeposit user
can use this module.

Why
---
First of all - you may ask "why should I use the FTP interface to upload files
to the Edeposit project?"

Answer is simple: it can save you a lot of work. Data uploaded over FTP are
automatically paired with metadata, you can use batch uploads and there is only
few steps compared with process in web interface.

You can make the whole process automatic and forget about it, if you want.

Usage
=====

Step 1: Configuration
---------------------
Before you can use this module, you need to allow FTP access and set password
for your FTP account in Edeposit site.

.. TODO: doplnit odkaz na edeposit
.. TODO: Screenshoty jak to m√° vypadat.

Step 2: FTP connection
----------------------
After you set all necessary details in `Step 1`, you can try to connect to the
FTP server.

Recommended FTP client is FileZilla_, but you can use whatever FTP client you
have.

.. _FileZilla: https://filezilla-project.org/

Following pictures and animation uses the ``caja`` FTP client from
`Linux Mint <http://www.linuxmint.com/>`_. You can use Explorer from Windows in
similar way by typing ``ftp://user@address`` to navigation bar.

When you connect to your account, you will probably notice that there is already
one file - usually named as ``delete_me_to_import_files.txt``. When you
delete this file, nothing happens, except that the file is there again.

It all right, don't worry about it now, it will be explained later.

Step 3: Pairing the data
------------------------
This module allows you to pair the `ebook` files with `metadata`. It can
automatically recognize this pairs and put them together at Edeposit site.

`Pair` always consist from `metadata` and `ebook` file. It can be created in
three different ways:

- Put together exactly two files in one directory, which contains nothing else.
  Name of the files is not important.
- Upload two files with same name into same directory. Files differ only in
  suffix (for example ``babicka.json`` and ``babicka.pdf``). There can be
  multiple samenamed pairs in one directory.
- Create two files named as `ISBN` of the book they are describing. No matter
  where the files will be in directory structure, they will be paired. For
  example ``/metadata/80-86056-31-7.json`` and
  ``/ebooky/80-86056-31-7.pdf``

All methods of pairing can be disabled in your user account.

Step 4: Triggering the import
-----------------------------
As you probably guessed, the import is triggered by deleting automatically
created `lock` file ``delete_me_to_import_files.txt``.

Reason for this is that FTP uploads are not atomic. Client can close connection,
open another and continue in file upload and it is still perfectly valid
upload of the file. There is no good way how to recognize that file was fully
uploaded, unless the user will tell us.

Import and error log
--------------------
As you can see at example animation, when I've uploaded the files and triggered
import, not only the `lock` file was created, but also the file named
``import.log.txt``.

This is important part of the communication API for automation of the upload,
because you get overall information at first line (``Status: Ok/Error``)
and details of processing each file in lines under the `status`.

In case of bad metadata files, error log is created and bad files are left where
they were found:

You can change some of the behavior in settings.

Metadata details
----------------
Every data file (ebook) should have metadata. It is not required, but it can
save you a lot of work later in web interface.

So far, the program has support for four formats of metadata:

- :doc:`JSON </api/ftp.decoders.parser_json>`
- :doc:`CSV </api/ftp.decoders.parser_csv>`
- :doc:`XML </api/ftp.decoders.parser_xml>`
- :doc:`YAML </api/ftp.decoders.parser_yaml>`

Metadata are recognized by their suffix - ``.json`` for JSON files, ``.csv`` for
CSV, ``.xml`` for XML and ``.yaml`` for YAML files.

Warning: **All metadata files should be encoded in UTF-8 encoding!**

Every metadata file has to contain few required fields and may contain also few
optional. Description and list of the fields can be found here:

- :doc:`/workflow/required`

In case that metadata file has bad structure, encoding or permissions, error
log is created and files are skipped.
