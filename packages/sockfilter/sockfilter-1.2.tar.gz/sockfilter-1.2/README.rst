sockfilter
==========

Block socket creation based on hostname/port to suppress unwanted
network activity.

.. pypi - Everything below this line goes into the description for PyPI.


Usage
-----

The intended use is for making sure your unit tests don't make network
connections. Activate ``sockfilter`` with a predicate like:

.. code:: python

    # only allow http connections to localhost
    def socket_address_allowed(address):
        return (address.host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1'] and
                address.port == 80)

    sockfilter.enable(socket_address_allowed)

Any subsequent attempts to open a connection at an address not satisfying
the predicate will raise ``sockfilter.SockFilterError``.


``with_sockfiltering`` decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from sockfilter import with_sockfiltering

    @with_sockfiltering(socket_address_allowed)
    def test_foo():
        foo()


``sockfiltering`` context manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from sockfilter import sockfiltering

    def test_foo():
        with sockfiltering(socket_address_allowed):
            foo()


``enable`` and ``disable``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    import sockfilter
    from unittest import TestCase

    class FooTest(TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            sockfilter.enable(socket_address_allowed)

        def tearDown(self):
            sockfilter.disable()

        def test_foo(self):
            foo()


Under the hood
--------------

Sockfilter works by monkey-patching Python's ``socket`` library,
inspired by HTTPretty_.
