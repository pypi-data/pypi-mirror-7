Description: # conttest
        
        Continuous testing helper, adapted from [1], but which makes no
        assumption about what tests you might want to run continuously while
        developing.  For more information, see [this blog post](http://eigenhombre.com/testing/2012/03/31/ontinuous-testing-in-python-clojure-and-blub/).
        
        **Any command supplied to the script will be run once and
        then repeated any time the code in the current working directory
        changes.**  You may wish to edit the IGNORE_* tuples to suit your
        particular setup.
        
        Note that ANY command you supply the script will be run, so be
        careful.  You have been warned!

        ### Installation
        
            ./setup.py install  # from source
        or
        
            easy_install conttest  # or use pip instead of easy_install
        
        ### Usage examples
        
            conttest nosetests
            conttest 'nosetests -q && pep8 -r .'
        
        Placing a file .conttest-excludes in the current working directory
        will exclude subdirectories, e.g.:
        
            .svn$
            .git
            build
            vendor/elastic*
            install
        
        will match files against the listed regular expressions and skip checking
        for changes in those directories.  This can save quite a bit of time and CPU
        during normal operation.
