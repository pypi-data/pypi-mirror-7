Definition files
================

natu's constants and units are defined in INI_ files.  Four of these files are
loaded by default.  Others may be added by appending the :attr:`definitions`
list in :mod:`natu.config`.  The files are processed sequentially, and the
definitions of symbols may depend on previous symbols.  The definitions begin
with base constants and continue with derived constants, empirically related
units, and derived units.

In the pages listed above, the symbols are presented in tables.  The INI_ format
is very similar.  An equals sign separates the first two columns ("Symbol" and
"Expression"), a comma starts the "Prefixable" column, and a semicolon
starts the last column ("Name & notes").

The "Prefixable" column may be *True*, *False*, or empty.  A unit has a *True*
or a *False* "Prefixable" entry.  If a unit is prefixable, `SI prefixes`_ are
added as needed (upon import).  A constant has an empty "Prefixable" entry.
Constants are never prefixable.

Single-character `SI prefixes`_ take precedence over the two-character prefix
'da' (`deca <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deca->`_).  As a hypothetical
example, if a unit with name and symbol 'am' is defined, 'dam' will refer to the
deciam, not the decametre_.  Also, non-prefixed units override the prefixed
ones.  For example, if a unit named 'dam' is established, it will override the
decametre_ (and deciam), which has the same symbol.

The "Name & notes" column is ignored.  It is only included for reference.

Some units such as `degC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius>`_ and `Np
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neper>`_ are not simple scaling factors.  The
"Expression" entry of these units contains a tuple with two functions.  The
first function maps a number to a quantity.  The second function is the inverse
of the first.  These are the first two arguments to construct a
lambda unit (:class:`~natu.types.LambdaUnit`).

`SI prefixes`_ can be applied to previously defined symbols except in the
definition of lambda units.

The sections of the INI_ files are only for organization (though required).  The
:mod:`natu.groups` submodules do not rely on the sections.  The dimensions of
the derived constants and units are calculated and used instead.
