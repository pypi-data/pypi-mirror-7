Description: Proctor
        =======
        
        Proctor is an HTTP proxy that will distribute requests across a number of Tor
        circuits, in a round-robin fashion.
        
        The Tor circuits are monitored for their health and restarted as appropriate.
        
        This is highly experimental software that likely misses a lot of corner
        cases. The main author is a newbie in the subject matter, and while he had a
        lot of fun doing this thing (which works well for his own use), use it at your
        own risk.
        
        Installation and usage
        ======================
        
        Installation:
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        This will start proctor on port 8080 with 2 Tor circuits:
        
            $ proctor

        Inspiration came from this article from Sebastian Wain over at Data Big Bang:

        This package is built on top of two awesome projects:
        
        *   pymiproxy (Nadeem Douba)
        
            <https://github.com/allfro/pymiproxy>
        
        *   SocksiPy-branch (several people, original author was Dan-Haim)
