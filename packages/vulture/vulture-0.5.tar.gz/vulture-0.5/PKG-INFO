Description: vulture - Find dead code
        ========================
        
        vulture finds unused classes, functions and variables in your code. This helps
        you cleanup and find errors in your programs. If you run it on both your
        library and test suite you can find untested code.
        
        Due to Python's dynamic nature it is impossible to find all dead code for a
        static code analyzer like vulture, because it ignores scopes and scans only
        token names. Additionally some dynamic items that are not explicitly called
        in the code may be incorrectly reported as dead code.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Fast: Uses static code analysis
        * Lightweight: Only one module
        * Tested: Comes with a test suite
        * Complements *pyflakes* and has the same output syntax
        * Supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        (Install ``pip``: ``sudo apt-get install python-pip``) ::
        
          $ sudo pip install -U vulture
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
          $ vulture --help
        
        After you have found and deleted dead code, run vulture again, because it
        may discover more dead code.
        
        
        Similar programs
        ----------------
        
        * vulture can be used together with *pyflakes*
        * The *coverage* module can find unused code more reliably, but requires all
          branches of the code to actually be run.
        
        
        About the name
        --------------
        
        A *vulture* eats dead animals. A group of feeding vultures is called a *wake*.
        Simples.
