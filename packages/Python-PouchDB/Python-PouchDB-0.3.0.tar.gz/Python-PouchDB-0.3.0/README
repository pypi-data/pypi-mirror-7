Python-PouchDB
==============

Introduction
------------

Python-PouchDB provides an interface to all the
goodness of the PouchDB JavaScript library (http://pouchdb.com/). It's
released under the Apache License v2 and it also offers a synchronous
API.

Uses QtWebKit internally, so either PySide, PyQt4 or PyQt5 is required.

Build process
-------------

Building/installing for Python is easy, just:

- python setup.py install
or
- python3 setup.py install

When making a change to the JavaScript code (in the 'js' sudirectory),
a rebuild of 'pouchdb/bundle.js' is required for changes to take effect.
You can do this by executing the following commands inside the 'js'
directory (requires node to be installed):

- ./install-node-dependencies
- cd python-pouchdb-js
- npm run build

(With only the last two being required after the first time.)

There's also ./build-plugins, which generates browser versions of the
plugins that are kept in the source tree, and ./build-all, which builds
both the plugins and the pouchdb/bundle.js file.
