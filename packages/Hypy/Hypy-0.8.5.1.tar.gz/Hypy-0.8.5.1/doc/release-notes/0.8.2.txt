This is of course on pypi and can be installed with easy_install or pip.  You will need Hyper Estraier installed to use it.

Release Version 0.8.2 (2009-01-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* I was unconditionally importing ez_setup in my setup.py and that makes it
  hard to easy_install.  Don't do that.
* No library functionality change, but now more users can install it.
