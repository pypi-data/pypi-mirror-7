        Git-backed Evernote replacement
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        Pre-requisites
        --------------
        
        (outside of PyPI):
        
        * Python 2.7
        * Pip/Easy Install
        * Git
        * `libmagic`_ (OS X specific issue; it's already installed on most Linux
          distros)
        * cygwin (Windows only requirement; see `issue #4`_)
        
        Installing magpie
        -----------------
        If you're a Python person, and you are using virtual environments, just::
        
            pip install magpie
        
        If you don't know what Python virtual environments are::
        
            sudo pip install magpie
        
        Setup Git Repo
        --------------
        
        git init
        ~~~~~~~~
        Locally::
        
            mkdir -p /path/to/notes/repo/
            cd /path/to/notes/repo/
            git init
        
        On `Github`_
        
        On `Bitbucket`_
        
        git config
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        Depending on what your environment is like, you may get a nasty error the first
        time you try to do something useful. This happened to me when I setup magpie to
        work with supervisor. In order to resolve this, I had to set the ``user.name``
        and ``user.email`` fields in git config. The error message on the magpie page
        will tell you the syntax.
        
        Launch magpie
        -------------
        In a Python virtualenv::
        
            magpie
        
        If you installed magpie with ``sudo``::
        
            sudo magpie
        
        Connect
        -------
        In browser, go to http://localhost:8080
        
        Configure
        ---------
        
        On the main page, there should be a link to configure magpie. (Alternatively,
        http://localhost:8080/config)
        
        Enter as much info here as you want. Username / Password are not required, but
        recommended. The only required field is repo. The path from "Init Git Repo"
        above should be entered here.
        
        Home Dir Config
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        As of version 0.0.4, if you have a ".magpie" directory in your home directory,
        you can store config files there, instead of the default path. You'll need to
        make this directory after installing magpie and before running it.
        Alternatively, you can create the directory and move the config files there
        manually.
        
        Useful Links
        ============
        
        * `magpie documentation`_
        * `magpie on Github`_
        * `magpie in PyPI`_
        * `Contributing`_
        * `To Do`_
        
        What is magpie?
        ===============
        I *love* `Evernote`_, but I no longer trust my data to cloud providers. Magpie
        is an attempt to make a reasonably sufficient Evernote replacement where the
        users control their data.
        
        Basically, magpie is just a web tool for managing text files in a git repo. In
        it, you can create notebooks (which are just folders); create, edit, and delete
        notes (which are just files). That's pretty much it. However, when you make any
        of these changes, they are automatically committed to git.
        
        Demo
        ----
        `A demo of magpie is available here`_
        
        (If you make changes and they disappear, it's because the demo resets itself
        every 15 minutes.)
        
        What isn't magpie?
        ==================
        
        * Complete (see `contributing`_)
        
        * Secure (magpie is only as safe as you make it. If your git repo is hosted on
          a public server, people will be able to read your notes. If you run it on an
          open network, people may be able to access your notes. Etc.)
        
        * Shiny (This is a side project written and maintained - so far - by a single
          person. It's never going to be as good or as useable as Evernote.)
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Markdown & HTML notes are rendered on the page
        
        * Uses git as a backend
        
            * Easy backups (if you know git): clone once, then push/pull to backup notes
        
            * track history, etc, just like with git (using git, not via magpie's web
              interface ... yet?)
        
        * Render "[ ]" and "[x]" as check boxes. Clicking them changes and saves the
          note.
        
        * Email yourself notes (see `emailing notes`_)
        
        * Scrape PDFs to make them searchable in magpie (see `pdf_scraper`_)
