	* Release 1.0.3.

	* Update external/viennacl-dev to version 1.5.2.
	  [91b7589a8fccc92927306e0ae3e061d85ac1ae93]

	  This contains two important fixes: one for a build failure on
	  Windows (PyViennaCL issue #17) relating to the re-enabling of the
	  Lanczos algorithm in 1.0.2, and one for an issue relating to
	  missing support for matrix transposition in the ViennaCL scheduler
	  (PyViennaCL issue #19, ViennaCL issue #73).

	  This release is also benefitial for performance on nVidia Kepler
	  GPUs, increasing the performance of matrix-matrix multiplications
	  to 600 GFLOPs in single precision on a GeForce GTX 680.

	* Fix bug when using integers in matrix and vector index key
	  [dbb1911fd788e66475f5717c1692be49d083a506]

	* Fix slicing of dense matrices (issue #18).
	  [9c745710ebc2a1066c7074b6c5de61b227017cc6]

	* Enable test for matrix transposition
	  [9e951103b883a3848aa2115df3edce73d347c09b]

	* Add non-square matrix-vector product test
	  [21dd29cd10ebe02a96ee23c20ee55401bc6c874f]

	[cbfb41fca3fb1f3db42fd7b3ccb8332b701d1e20]

	* Enable eigenvalue computations for compressed and coordinate
  	matrices.
	[8ecee3b200a92ae99b72653a823c1f60e62f75dd]

	* Fix matrix-vector product for non-square matrices (issue #13).
	[bf3aa2bf91339df72b6f7561afaf8b12aad57cda]

	* Link against rt on Linux (issue #12).
