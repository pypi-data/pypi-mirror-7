Description: Summary
        -------
        The `keyword` cube provides classification by using hierarchies of keywords to
        classify content.
        
        Each classification is represented using a `Classification` entity, which will
        hold a keywords tree.
        
        There is two types of keywords:
        
        - `Keyword` which contains a description,
        
        - `CodeKeyword` which contains the keyword description and the associated code.
        
        In order to link an entity to a keyword, you have to add a relation `applied_to`
        in the schema.
        
        Each keyword has the `subkeyword_of` relation definition. This allows to
        navigate in the classification without a Modified Preorder Tree Traversal
        representation of the data.
        
        Some methods are defined in order to get parents and children or get the status
        of a keyword (leaf or root).
        
        See also `cubicweb-tag`_ as another (simpler) way to classify content.
