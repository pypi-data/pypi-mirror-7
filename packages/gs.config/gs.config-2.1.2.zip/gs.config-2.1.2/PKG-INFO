        Introduction
        ============
        
        Sometimes configuration is complex, such as when multiple sets of
        configuration is needed because multiple instances of a system
        (such as GroupServer [#gs]_) are running on the same setup. In
        this case each instance is made up of a set of components, and
        each component is made up of configuration options:
        
        * Instance
        
          + Component
          
            - Configuration options
            - More configuration options
        
          + Component 2
        
            - Different configuration options
        
        * Another instance
        
        Sadly the ConfigParser_ system does not allow for this hierarchy,
        but ``gs.config`` does, by using the *name* *space* to provide
        the relationship between an instance and the component. In
        particular, this product supplies a `Config class`_ to read a
        file_ of a particular structure.
        
        ``Config`` Class
        ================
        
        The ``gs.config.Config`` class that represents the system
        configuration. See the Sphinx documentation in this module for
        more information.
        
        File
        ====
        
        The instance is marked with the name ``[config-${name}]``, where
        ``${name}`` is the name of the instance. For example ``[config-production]``
        for the instance ``production``.
        
        For each component the set of sections is then supplied::
        
          [config-production]
          database = production
          smtp = external
          cache = production
          tokenauth = production
          
        The configuration for a component can be shared by multiple
        instances::
        
          [config-staging]
          database = production
          smtp = dead
          cache = none
          tokenauth = production
        
        Each component is a configuration section, with a name of the form
        ``[${component}-${name}]``. For example ``[smtp-external]`` for the 
        smtp section named *external*.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        In the example below three instances are configured: one for a
        test-server, one for a staging server, and one for a production
        server. Each instance has two components: a database, and an SMTP
        server::
        
          [config-test]
          database = test
          smtp = test
        
          [config-staging]
          database = live
          smtp = test
        
          [config-production]
          database = live
          smtp = live
        
          # An actual configuration section for each configuration set
          [database-test]
          dsn = postgres://name:pass@server/database-test
        
          [database-live]
          dsn = postgres://name:pass@server/database-live
        
          [smtp-test]
          server = localhost
          port = 2525
        
          [smtp-live]
          server = external
          port = 25
        
        When the configuration is instantiated, an ID is passed. This ID identifies
        the configuration set that is currently being accessed. If an ID is not
        passed, an attempt is made to get the ID from the environment
        automatically. At the moment this is specific to the GroupServer_
        environment, though care is taken to ensure that it will fall back
        gracefully to being passed an ID.

        .. [#gs] While originally written for GroupServer_, there is no
                 code in this product that is specific to
                 GroupServer. However, this product is used to configure
                 the database_, SMTP_, cache_, and `token
                 authentication`_ for GroupServer.
