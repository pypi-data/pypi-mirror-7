Multi-Threading
---------------
This is being used right now in production on a small project and I have made an attempt to make it thread-safe, but I'm a complete beginner at this subject. Any help on this would be **HIGHLY** appreciated. Can someone please check if the custom `postgresql_backend <https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas/blob/master/tenant_schemas/postgresql_backend/base.py>`_ is thread-safe? If there is a way to write a test for this, it would be awesome. Please send in your feedback at `issue #2 <https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas/issues/2>`_.
