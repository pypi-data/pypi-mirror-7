These .svg files use the Lato and Inconsolata fonts. To let web
browsers display them correctly on arbitrary computers that may or may
not have the fonts installed, we have carefully inserted some magic
into the <defs> block at the top of the .svg file:

  <style>
    @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700,400italic,700italic|Inconsolata);
  </style>

This has to be done in a regular text editor -- inkscape knows nothing
about <style> blocks or web-fonts like this. (Fortunately, it does
preserve the block through load/save cycles, though.)

You should probably have the fonts installed if you want to edit the
files -- inkscape doesn't know how to interpret CSS webfonts, so if
you don't have them available on your system then it will display
everything using a fallback font. (The key to how this all works is
that the actual text blocks in the .svg file just specify the name of
the font to be used, and then it's the rendering software's job to
find a font with the appropriate name. Inkscape will look for such
fonts by checking the fonts generally available on your system. Web
browsers will try that, but will also look into @font-face
specifications, which specify font-name -> url mappings.)

So keep an eye out in case this ever gets lost, and make sure to
update it in case the fonts ever change. And then make sure to test it
by viewing the file in a web browser on a system that *doesn't* have
these fonts installed.
