-*-outline-*-

Actionable issues are at https://bitbucket.org/invitae/hgvs/issues.
This file is intended for ideas that need fleshing out.

* class restructuring
current: intervalmapper, transcriptmapper, hgvsmapper, projector, validator

* clean/standardize naming
** Strive for this:
- hgvs_{,g,c,p} -- string
- var_{,g,c,p} -- variant
- ival -- interval
- location stuff: interval, position, location, pos, loc, start/end v. start/stop, posedit


** violations:
- hgvsmapper -- would become variantmapper
- location-ish stuff -- everywhere

* move intrinsic validation to posedits (and recurse)
