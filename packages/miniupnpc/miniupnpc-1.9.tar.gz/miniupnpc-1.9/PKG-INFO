        For the comfort of Win32 users, bsdqueue.h is included in the distribution.
        Its licence is included in the header of the file.
        bsdqueue.h is a copy of the sys/queue.h of an OpenBSD system.
        
        
        * miniUPnP Client - miniUPnPc *
        
        To compile, simply run 'gmake' (could be 'make' on your system).
        Under win32, to compile with MinGW, type "mingw32make.bat".
        MS Visual C solution and project files are supplied in the msvc/ subdirectory.
        
        The compilation is known to work under linux, FreeBSD,
        OpenBSD, MacOS X, AmigaOS and cygwin.
        The official AmigaOS4.1 SDK was used for AmigaOS4 and GeekGadgets for AmigaOS3.
        upx (http://upx.sourceforge.net) is used to compress the win32 .exe files.
        
        To install the library and headers on the system use :
        > su
        > make install
        > exit
        
        alternatively, to install into a specific location, use :
        > INSTALLPREFIX=/usr/local make install
        
        upnpc.c is a sample client using the libminiupnpc.
        To use the libminiupnpc in your application, link it with
        libminiupnpc.a (or .so) and use the following functions found in miniupnpc.h,
        upnpcommands.h and miniwget.h :
        - upnpDiscover()
        - miniwget()
        - parserootdesc()
        - GetUPNPUrls()
        - UPNP_* (calling UPNP methods)
        
        Note : use #include <miniupnpc/miniupnpc.h> etc... for the includes
        and -lminiupnpc for the link
        
        Discovery process is speeded up when MiniSSDPd is running on the machine.
        
        
        * Python module *
        
        you can build a python module with 'make pythonmodule'
        and install it with 'make installpythonmodule'.
        setup.py (and setupmingw32.py) are included in the distribution.
