# XXX: BradCrittenden 2014-05-23: jujuclient 0.17.5 does not specify the
# version of websocket-client to use.  Remove websocket-client as a dependency
# here when moving to a newer jujuclient that correctly specifies the
# version.
# This is listed as a testing requirement so that, when dh_python2 translates
# Python dependencies to Debian dependencies, websocket-client is not included.
