Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``plone.app.debugtoolbar`` provides a wealth of debug information about a
        running Plone site at your fingertips. Simply install it in your build
        (e.g. by adding it to the ``eggs`` list in your Buildout and re-running
        buildout) and install it into your Plone site.
        
        You should now see a ``Debug`` link at the top of your site. Click it to open
        the debug drawer. Click on a panel to view relevant information.
        
        Panels include:
        
        * Context, showing information about the current content object
        * Interactive, providing an interactive Python prompt through which you can
          interact with the current context (only available to users with the
          ``Manage portal`` permission)
        * Request, showing information about the request that produced the current page
        * Response, showing informationa about the response that produced the current
          page
        * Published, showing information about the page template or view that was
          published
        * Theme, showing information about the current theme and browser layers
        * User, showing information about the current user
        * Workflow, showing information about workflow and security
        * Zope, showing information about how the Zope server is configured
        * Versions, listing the versions of every package known to the Zope process
        
        Safety
        ======
        
        The debug toolbar provides a lot of information about your Plone site that you
        may not want the world to know. It could also have a noticable performance
        impact, and for users with the ``Manage portal`` permission it provides access
        to an interactive interpreter where arbitrary Python statements can be executed,
        allowing a user to bypass Zope security.
        
        In other words: **Do not install this package on your production server**.
        
        Integration
        ===========
        
        Each panels is included as a viewlet. You can register new panels using a
        viewlet registration like this::
        
            <browser:viewlet
                name="plone.app.debugtoolbar.somepanel"
                manager="plone.app.debugtoolbar.browser.interfaces.IDebugToolbarViewletManager"
                class=".somepanel.SomePanelViewlet"
                template="somepanel.pt"
                permission="zope2.View"
                layer="plone.app.debugtoolbar.browser.interfaces.IDebugToolbarLayer"
                />
        
        See ``plone.app.debugtoolbar.browser`` for plenty of examples of panels.
