Description: Passport
        ========
        
        *Light weight configuration management using Consul*
        
        Passport is a command line tool for rendering templates containing information
        gained from Consul's Service Discovery API and Key/Value database.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Passport is available via pypi and can be installed with easy_install or pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install passport
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            usage: passport.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--datacenter DATACENTER]
                               {kv,file} path destination
                                    
        Example
        -------
        
        As an example, the following template is stored in the KV database as
        ``templates/memcached/memcached.conf``
        
        .. code:: python
        
            {% set nodes = ['%s:%s' % (r['Address'], r['ServicePort']) for r in consul.catalog.service('memcached')] %}
        
            [memcached]
                servers = {{ ','.join(nodes) }}
        
        Invoking passport will render the file with a list of all memcached nodes to
        ``/etc/memcached.conf``.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            passport kv templates/memcached/memcached.conf /etc/memcached.conf
        
        And the output would look something like:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
        [memcached]
            servers = 172.17.0.7:11211,172.17.0.8:11211
        
        Template rendering is done via the `Tornado Template <https://tornado.readthedocs.org/en/latest/template.html>`_ engine.
        
        Todo
        ----
        
        - Add a *managed* mode where Passport will check for new services on a regular interval and when changes occur, update the rendered template and notify a process using HUP
        - Add daemonization for managed mode
        - Add the ability to specify pairs of templates/destinations in a single invocation
