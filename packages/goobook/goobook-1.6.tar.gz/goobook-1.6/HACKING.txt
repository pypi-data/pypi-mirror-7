Release HOWTO
=============

To make a release, edit "version" in setup.py and run:

  python setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist

To upload the generated source distribution to PyPI, run:

  python setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist register upload

Note that if you ignore the ``egg_info -RDb ""`` part, Distribute will generate
a development release tarball with ``.dev``.
