Description: TACL
        ====
        
        tacl is a tool for performing basic text analysis on the texts
        available from the `Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association`_
        (CBETA). It is largely generic, however, and can operate with minor
        modifications on other corpora.
        
        The code is developed at https://github.com/ajenhl/tacl/ and the
        documentation is available at http://tacl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ -
        Read the Docs unfortunately does not display the script usage
        documentation, but running the commands under `Usage` below gives the
        same information.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using `Python 3`_ (minimum version 3.3), either run ``pip install
        tacl`` or download the code manually and run ``python setup.py
        install``, or install . Requires `SQLite`_, the `biopython`_ suite of
        tools, the `lxml`_ XML library, and the `pandas`_ data analysis
        library. Python on Windows comes with the SQLite DLL, and on all
        platforms the other dependencies are installed automatically when tacl
        is installed with ``pip``).
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run ``tacl -h`` for a listing of available subcommands, and ``tacl
        <subcommand> -h`` for help on a specific subcommand.
