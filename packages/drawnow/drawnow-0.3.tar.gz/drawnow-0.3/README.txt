### ``drawnow`` for matplotlib

MatlabÂ® has a great feature where it allows you to update a figure. You
can simply call ``drawnow`` and have your figure update. This is nice if
you're running a simulation and want to see the results every iteration.
It'd sure be nice if Python/matplotlib had a similar feature to update
the plot each iteration. This feature adds that functionality to
matplotlib.

Usage:

.. code:: python

    from drawnow import refresh

    ion() # enable interactivity, can be default
    x = zeros((N,N))

    def function_to_draw_figure():
        #figure() # don't call, otherwise new window opened
        imshow(x) # python's global scope
        #show()   # don't call show()!

    figure()
    for i in arange(x):
        x.flat[i] = 1
        refresh(function_to_draw_figure)
        #show()

If you want to wait for confirmation after update, call
``refresh(function_to_draw_figure, confirm=True)``.

If you only want to show the figure once, call
``refresh(function_to_draw_figure, show_once=True)``

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two options:

1. Download this repository and run ``python setup.py install``.
