Installing calcpkg:

There are a multitude of ways to install calcpkg.

You will need a Python 2.x install (I'm sorry, 3.x support will get added
soon, I just haven't gotten around to it) with setuptools.

The recommended way is to use pip. On a system with pip, run the following
command:

```pip install calcpkg```

(Optionally, run the command as "sudo pip install calcpkg").

This will pull the package straight from PyPI, the Python Package Index.


Other ways: you can download an archive from ticalc.org and install it
manually, or d

Or, if you want to be really meta, you can use calcpkg to update itself.

A) Download the latest release from ticalc.org:

-------------------------------------------------------

If on Windows:

1. Download the release here:
http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/433/43348.html

2. If on 64-bit Windows, run the "win-amd64.exe" executable.

3. If on 32-bit Windows, run the "win32.exe" executable.

4. If neither of those executables work, extract the .zip archive, cd into it,
and run the following command:

> python setup.py install

-------------------------------------------------------

If on Linux (or any other system):

1. Download the release here:
http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/433/43369.html

2. On the command line, run the following commands:

$ tar xfz calcpkg*.tar.gz
$ cd calcpkg*
$ sudo python setup.py install

--------------------------------------------------------

B) Download from github:

Run the following commands in a terminal:

$ git clone https://github.com/TC01/calcpkg
$ cd calcpkg
$ sudo python setup.py install

--------------------------------------------------------

C) Use calcpkg itself:

Run the following commands in a terminal:

$ sudo calcpkg -r ticalc update
$ calcpkg -fx -c win get calcpkg
$ cd calcpkg*
$ sudo python setup.py install

I don't recommend actually doing this, because PyPI will be updated faster
than ticalc.org (and github the fastest, obviously), but it's fun. :)
