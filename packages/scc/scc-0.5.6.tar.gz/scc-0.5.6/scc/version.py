# Calculates the current version number.  If possible, this is the
# output of “git describe”, modified to conform to the versioning
# scheme that setuptools uses.  If “git describe” returns an error
# (most likely because we're in an unpacked copy of a release tarball,
# rather than in a git working copy), then we fall back on reading the
# contents of the RELEASE-VERSION file.
#
# To use this script, simply import it your setup.py file, and use the
# results of get_git_version() as your package version:
#
# from version import *
#
# setup(
#     version=get_git_version(),
#     .
#     .
#     .
# )
#
# This will automatically update the RELEASE-VERSION file, if
# necessary.  Note that the RELEASE-VERSION file should *not* be
# checked into git; please add it to your top-level .gitignore file.
#
# You'll probably want to distribute the RELEASE-VERSION file in your
# sdist tarballs; to do this, just create a MANIFEST.in file that
# contains the following line:
#
#   include RELEASE-VERSION
