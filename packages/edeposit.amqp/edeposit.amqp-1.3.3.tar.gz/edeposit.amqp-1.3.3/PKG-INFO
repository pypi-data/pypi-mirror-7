        `Edeposit <http://edeposit.nkp.cz/>`_ project. Main purpose is to provide
        configuration data to AMQP server and generic daemons, to run the modules.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Module is hosted at `PYPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_, and can be easily

        Acceptance tests
        ================
        `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`__ is used to test the code.

        Tests can be invoked manually (from the root of the package):
        
        ::
        
            $ pybot -W 80 --pythonpath edeposit/amqp/tests/:src edeposit/amqp/tests/; (cd docs/; make html)
        
        Or continuously using nosier:
        
        ::
        
            $ nosier -p edeposit -b 'export' "pybot -W 80 --pythonpath edeposit/amqp/tests/:src edeposit/amqp/tests/; (cd docs/; make html)"
