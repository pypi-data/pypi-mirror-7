        *********************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org/
        .. _`vanderlee/colorpicker`: http://www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.ehynds_multiselect``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``multiselect`` from ``js.ehynds_multiselect`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.ehynds_multiselect import multiselect
          >>> multiselect.need()
