Description: datetime-interval
        =================
        
        The builtin ``datetime`` module provides classes for points in time
        (``date``, and ``datetime``) as well as durations (``timedelta``), but
        it does not account for time durations at a specific point. This module
        provides ``Interval``, which contains a start and end ``date`` or
        ``datetime``, and a duration ``timedelta``. This is useful for
        representing calendar events. This module also provides
        ``PeriodicInterval`` which can be used for recurring events, by
        containing a period ``timedelta`` and a count of occurrences (either an
        ``int`` or ``forever``).
        
        TODO:
        -----
        
        -  Interval ``isoformat`` method (start/end).
        
           -  This wouldn't work on PeriodicInterval, as recurring intervals
              have a different semantics in ISO 8601.
        
        -  Property-based testing with ``props``
        -  Add operators (in, +, -, \*, [], etc.)
        -  How to account for e.g. every Tuesday and Thursday
