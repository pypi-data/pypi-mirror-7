        Installation 
        ------------
        
        Simplest way (if you have pip installed): download from Python Package Index and install:
        
        pip install pygeomod
        
        For more information on pip, see http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/quickstart.html
        
        NOTE: to be on the safe side, it is a good idea to install experiemntal Python packages into a virtual environment first:

        Alternatively, you can download the distribution (either from PyPI or from github) and simply run
        
        python setup.py install
