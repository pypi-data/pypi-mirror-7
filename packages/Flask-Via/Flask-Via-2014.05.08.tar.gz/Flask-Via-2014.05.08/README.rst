``Flask-Via``
=============

Inspired by the Django URL configuration system, ``Flask-Via`` is designed to
add similar functionality to Flask applications which have grown beyond a
simple single file application.

Example
-------

.. sourcecode:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.via import Via
    from flask.ext.via.routers.default import Basic

    app = Flask(__name__)

    def foo(bar=None):
        return 'Foo View!'

    routes = [
        Basic('/foo', foo),
        Basic('/foo/<bar>', foo, endpoint='foo2'),
    ]

    via = Via()
    via.init_app(app, route_module='flask_via.examples.basic')

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(debug=True)

Why?
----

Growing your application can be quite difficult when it's not always clear
where and how your routes are discovered. This can lead to a cluttered
application factory method when all your routes are defined at application
creation - resulting in code which is difficult to maintain, not to mention
messy.

A better solution is to define your routes in a ``routes.py`` and automatically
load them at application start up. This is what ``Flask-Via`` helps to do.

Third party Flask extensions don't always follow the same conventions for
adding routes to an application, so ``Flask-Via`` has been designed to be easy
for developers to write their own custom routers. For an example of this, take
a look at the bundled ``Flask-Restful`` Resource_ router.

If you do write a custom router that is useful to you, it will probably be
useful to someone else so please do contribute back :)
