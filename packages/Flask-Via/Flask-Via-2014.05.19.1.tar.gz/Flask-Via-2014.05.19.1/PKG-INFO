Description: ``Flask-Via``
        =============
        
        Inspired by the Django URL configuration system, ``Flask-Via`` is designed to
        add similar functionality to Flask applications which have grown beyond a
        simple single file application.

        Example
        -------
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask.ext.via import Via
            from flask.ext.via.routers.default import Functional
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
        
            def foo(bar=None):
                return 'Foo View!'
        
            routes = [
                Functional('/foo', foo),
                Functional('/foo/<bar>', foo, endpoint='foo2'),
            ]
        
            via = Via()
            via.init_app(app, route_module='flask_via.examples.basic')
        
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                app.run(debug=True)
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        Growing your application can be quite difficult when it's not always clear
        where and how your routes are discovered. This can lead to a cluttered
        application factory method when all your routes are defined at application
        creation - resulting in code which is difficult to maintain, not to mention
        messy.
        
        A better solution is to define your routes in a ``routes.py`` and automatically
        load them at application start up. This is what ``Flask-Via`` helps to do.
        
        Third party Flask extensions don't always follow the same conventions for
        adding routes to an application, so ``Flask-Via`` has been designed to be easy
        for developers to write their own custom routers. For an example of this, take
        a look at the bundled ``Flask-Restful`` Resource_ router.
        
        If you do write a custom router that is useful to you, it will probably be
        useful to someone else so please do contribute back :)
