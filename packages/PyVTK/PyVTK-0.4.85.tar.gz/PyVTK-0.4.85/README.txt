REQUIREMENTS
------------

     Python  - pyvtk is developed under Python 2.1. But it is tested
               to work also under Python 2.0 and Python 1.5.2.
               In future, Python 1.5 will be supported only if one
               asks for it.

BUILDING and INSTALLING

         python setup.py install

     Python 1.x users, execute
         make install

USAGE
-----
     >>> import pyvtk

     To learn how to use pyvtk.VtkData, see examples in examples/ directory.
     For reference, execute

         pydoc pyvtk.VtkData

     or in Python:
