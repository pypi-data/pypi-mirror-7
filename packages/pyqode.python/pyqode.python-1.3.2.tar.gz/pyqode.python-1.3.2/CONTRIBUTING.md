Pull Requests are great (on the dev branch)! Readme/Documentation changes are ok in the master branch.

    Fork the Repo on github.
    Add your name to AUTHORS.txt
    Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the dev branch.

The master branch is used for the stable releases, following the [git workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

Please use **PEP8** to style your code.

Use the issue to tracker to report bugs, open feature requests and ask questions.
