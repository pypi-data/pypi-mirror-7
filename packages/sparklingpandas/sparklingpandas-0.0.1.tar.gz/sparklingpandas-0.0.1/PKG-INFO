        SparklingPandas
        ===========
        
        SparklingPandas aims to make it easy to use the distributed computing power of PySpark to scale your data anlysis with Pandas.
        
        Documentation
        =========
        
        None (right now). You can find some slides in the slides/ directory
        
        Requirements
        =========
        
        The primary requirement of SparklingPandas is that you have a recent (v1.0-SNAPSHOT currently) version of Spark installed - <http://spark.apache.org>
        
        Using
        =========
        
        Make sure you have the SPARK_HOME enviroment variable set correctly, as SparklingPandas uses this for including the PySpark libraries
        
        Other than that you can install SparklingPandas with pip and just import it. The primary unit of SparklingPandas is a PRDD (Pandas Resillent Distributed Data Set)
        
        State
        =========
        
        This is in early development and should not be considered usable.
