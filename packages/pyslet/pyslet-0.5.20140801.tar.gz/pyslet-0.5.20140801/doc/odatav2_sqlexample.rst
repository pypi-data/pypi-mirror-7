A SQL-Backed Data Service
=========================

The sample code for this service is in the samples directory in the
Pyslet distribution.

This project demonstrates how to construct a simple OData service based
on the :py:class:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds.SQLiteEntityContainer` class. 

We don't need any customisations, this class does everything we need
'out of the box'.  If you want to use a database other than SQLite you
will need to create a new implementation of the generic
:py:class:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds.SQLEntityContainer`.  See the reference
documentation for :py:mod:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds` for details on what is
involved.  You shouldn't have to change much!

Step 1: Creating the Metadata Model
-----------------------------------

If you haven't read the :doc:`odatav2_memexample` yet it is a good idea
to do that to get a primer on how providers work.  The actual
differences between writing a SQL-backed service and one backed by the
in-memory implementation are minimal.  I haven't repeated code here if
it is essentially the same as the code shown in the previous example,
but remember that the full working source is available in the samples
directory.

For this project, I've chosen to write an OData service that exposes
weather data for my home town of Cambridge, England.  The choice of data
set is purely because I have access to over 325,000 data points
stretching back to 1995 thanks to the excellent Weather Station website
run by the University of Cambridge's Digital Technology Group:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/

We start with our metadata model, which we write by hand.  There are two
entity sets.  The first contains the actual data readings from the
weather station and the second contains notes relating to known
inaccuracies in the data.  I've included a navigation property so that
it is easy to see which note, if any, applies to a data point.

Here's the model::

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
	<edmx:Edmx Version="1.0" xmlns:edmx="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/06/edmx"
		xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata">
		<edmx:DataServices m:DataServiceVersion="2.0">
			<Schema Namespace="WeatherSchema" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2006/04/edm">
				<EntityContainer Name="CambridgeWeather" m:IsDefaultEntityContainer="true">
					<EntitySet Name="DataPoints" EntityType="WeatherSchema.DataPoint"/>
					<EntitySet Name="Notes" EntityType="WeatherSchema.Note"/>
					<AssociationSet Name="DataPointNotes" Association="WeatherSchema.DataPointNote">
						<End Role="DataPoint" EntitySet="DataPoints"/>
						<End Role="Note" EntitySet="Notes"/>
					</AssociationSet>
				</EntityContainer>
				<EntityType Name="DataPoint">
					<Key>
						<PropertyRef Name="TimePoint"/>
					</Key>
					<Property Name="TimePoint" Type="Edm.DateTime" Nullable="false" Precision="0" m:FC_TargetPath="SyndicationUpdated" m:FC_KeepInContent="true"/>
					<Property Name="Temperature" Type="Edm.Single" m:FC_TargetPath="SyndicationTitle" m:FC_KeepInContent="true"/>
					<Property Name="Humidity" Type="Edm.Byte"/>
					<Property Name="DewPoint" Type="Edm.Single"/>
					<Property Name="Pressure" Type="Edm.Int16"/>
					<Property Name="WindSpeed" Type="Edm.Single"/>
					<Property Name="WindDirection" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="3" Unicode="false"/>
					<Property Name="WindSpeedMax" Type="Edm.Single"/>
					<Property Name="SunRainStart" Type="Edm.Time" Precision="0"></Property>
					<Property Name="Sun" Type="Edm.Single"/>
					<Property Name="Rain" Type="Edm.Single"/>
					<NavigationProperty Name="Note" Relationship="WeatherSchema.DataPointNote"
						FromRole="DataPoint" ToRole="Note"/>
				</EntityType>
				<EntityType Name="Note">
					<Key><PropertyRef Name="ID"></PropertyRef></Key>
					<Property Name="ID" Type="Edm.Int32" Nullable="false"/>
					<Property Name="StartDate" Type="DateTime" Nullable="false" Precision="0"/>
					<Property Name="EndDate" Type="DateTime" Nullable="false" Precision="0"/>
					<Property Name="Details" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="1024" Nullable="false" FixedLength="false"/>
					<NavigationProperty Name="DataPoints" Relationship="WeatherSchema.DataPointNote"
						FromRole="Note" ToRole="DataPoint"/>
				</EntityType>
				<Association Name="DataPointNote">
					<End Role="DataPoint" Type="WeatherSchema.DataPoint" Multiplicity="*"/>
					<End Role="Note" Type="WeatherSchema.Note" Multiplicity="0..1"/>
				</Association>
			</Schema>
		</edmx:DataServices>
	</edmx:Edmx>

I've added two feed customisations to this model.  The TimePoint field
of the data point will be echoed in the Atom 'updated' field and the
Temperature field will become the Atom title.  This will make my OData
service more interesting to look at in a standard browser.

As before, we'll save the model to a file and load it when our script
starts up.

To link the model to a SQLite database back-end we need to create an
instance of
:py:class:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds.SQLiteEntityContainer`::

	SAMPLE_DB='weather.db'

	def MakeContainer(doc,drop=False):
		if drop and os.path.isfile(SAMPLE_DB):
			os.remove(SAMPLE_DB)
		create=not os.path.isfile(SAMPLE_DB)
		container=SQLiteEntityContainer(file_path=SAMPLE_DB,containerDef=doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather'])
		if create:
			container.create_all_tables()

This function handles the only SQL-specific part of our project.  When
we create a SQLite container we have to pass *two* keyword arguments:
rather than just the container definition as we did for the in-memory
implementation.  We don't need to return a value because the SQL
implementation is bound to the model that was passed in *doc*.

The code above automatically creates the tables if the database doesn't
exist yet.  This is fine if you are starting from scratch but if you
want to expose an existing database you'll need to work backwards from
your existing schema when creating the model.  Anyway, letting Pyslet
create your SQL tables for you neglects your DBA who will almost
certainly want to create indexes to optimise performance and tweak the
model to get the best out of your platform.  The automatically generated
SQL script is supposed to be a starting point, not the complete solution.

For example, the data set I used for this project has over 300,000
records in it.  At the end of this exercise I had an OData server
capable of serving this information from a SQLite database but example
URLs were taking 10s or more on my laptop to load.  I created an index
on the Temperature column using the SQLite command line and the page
load times were instantaneous::

	sqlite> create index TIndex ON DataPoints(Temperature);


Modelling an Existing Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For simple data properties it should be fairly easy to map to the EDM. 
Here is the way Pyslet maps simple types in the EDM to SQL types:

==================  =========================================================
   EDM Type			SQL Equivalent
------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
Edm.Binary          BINARY(MaxLength) if FixedLength specified
Edm.Binary          VARBINARY(MaxLength) if no FixedLength
Edm.Boolean         BOOLEAN
Edm.Byte            SMALLINT
Edm.DateTime        TIMESTAMP
Edm.DateTimeOffset  CHARACTER(20), ISO 8601 string representation is used
Edm.Decimal         DECIMAL(Precision,Scale), defaults 10,0
Edm.Double          FLOAT
Edm.Guid            BINARY(16)
Edm.Int16           SMALLINT
Edm.Int32           INTEGER
Edm.Int64           BIGINT
Edm.SByte           SMALLINT
Edm.Single          REAL
Edm.String          CHAR(MaxLength) or VARCHAR(MaxLength)
Edm.String          NCHAR(MaxLength) or NVARCHAR(MaxLength) if Unicode="true"
Edm.Time            TIME
==================  =========================================================  

Navigation properties, and complex properties do not map as easily but
they can still be modelled.  To start with, look at the way the SQLite
implementation turns our model into a SQL CREATE TABLE statement::

	>>> import weather
	>>> doc=weather.LoadMetadata()
	>>> weather.MakeContainer(doc)
	>>> dataPoints=doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather.DataPoints'].OpenCollection()
	>>> print dataPoints.CreateTableQuery()[0]
	CREATE TABLE "DataPoints" ("TimePoint" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	"Temperature" REAL, "Humidity" SMALLINT, "DewPoint" REAL, "Pressure"
	SMALLINT, "WindSpeed" REAL, "WindDirection" TEXT, "WindSpeedMax"
	REAL, "SunRainStart" REAL, "Sun" REAL, "Rain" REAL,
	"DataPointNotes_ID" INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY ("TimePoint"), CONSTRAINT
	"DataPointNotes" FOREIGN KEY ("DataPointNotes_ID") REFERENCES
	"Notes"("ID"))

After all the data properties there's an additional property called
DataPointNotes_ID which is a foreign key into into the Notes table. 
This was created automatically to model the association set that links
the two EntitySets in the container.

Pyslet generates foreign keys for the following types of association:

============    =======================================
0..1 to 1       With UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints
\* to 1         With a NOT NULL constraint only
\* to 0..1      No additional constraints
============    =======================================

When these relationships are reversed the foreign key is of course
created in the target table.

What if your foreign key has a different name, say, NoteID?  Pyslet
gives you the chance to override all name mappings.  To fix up this part
of the model you need to create a derived class of the base class
:py:class:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds.SQLEntityContainer` and override the
:py:meth:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds.SQLEntityContainer.mangle_name` method.

In this case, the method would have been called like this::

	quotedName=container.mangle_name((u"DataPoints",u"DataPointNotes",u"ID"))

There is a single argument consisting of a tuple.  The first item is the
name of the EntitySet (SQL TABLE) and the subsequent items complete a
kind of 'path' to the value.  Foreign keys have a path comprising of the
AssociationSet name followed by the name of the key field in the target
EntitySet.  The default implementation just joins the path with an
underscore character.  The method must return a suitably quoted value to
use for the column name.  To complete the example, here is how our
subclass might implement this method to ensure that the foreign key is
called 'NoteID' instead of 'DataPointNotes_ID'::

	def mangle_name(self,source_path):
		if source_path==(u"DataPoints",u"DataPointNotes",u"ID"):
			return self.quote_identifier(u'NoteID')
		else:
			return super(MyCustomerContainer,self).mangle_name(source_path)

You may be wondering why we don't expose the foreign key field in the
model. Some libraries might force you to expose the foreign key in order
to expose the navigation property but Pyslet takes the opposite
approach. The whole point of navigation properties is to hide away
details like foreign keys. If you really want to access the value you
can always use an expansion and select the key field in the target
entity.  Exposing it in the source entity just tempts you in to writing
code that 'knows' about your model for example, if we had exposed the
foreign key in our example as a simple property we might have been
tempted to do something like this::		

	noteID=dataPoint['DataPointNotes_ID'].value
	if noteID is not None:
		note=noteCollection[noteID]
		# do something with the note
		
When we should be doing something like this::

	note=dataPoint['Note']
	if note is not None:
		# do something with the note
	
Complex types are handled in the same way as foreign keys, the path
being comprised of the name(s) of the complex field(s) terminated by the
name of a simple property.  For example, if you have a complex type called
Address and two properties of type Address called "Home" and "Work" you
might end up with SQL that looked like this::

	CREATE TABLE Employee (
		...
		Home_Street NVARCHAR(50),
		Home_City NVARCHAR(50),
		Home_Phone NVARCHAR(50),
		Work_Street NVARCHAR(50),
		Work_City NVARCHAR(50),
		Work_Phone NVARCHAR(50)
		...
		)

You often see SQL written like this anyway so if you want to tweak the
mapping to put a Complex type in your model you can.

Finally, we need to deal with the symmetric relationships, 1 to 1 and \*
to \*.  These are modelled by separate tables.  1 to 1 relationships are
best avoided, the advantages over combining the two entities into a
single larger entity are marginal given OData's $select option which
allows you to pick a subset of the fields anyway.  If you have them in
your SQL schema already you might consider creating a view to combine
them before attempting to map them to the metadata model.

Either way, both types of symmetric relationships get mapped to a table
with the name of the AssociationSet.  There are two sets of foreign
keys, one for each of the EntitySets being joined.  The paths are rather
complex and are explained in detail in
:py:class:`~pyslet.odata2.sqlds.SQLAssociationCollection`.


Step 2: Test the Model
----------------------

Before we add the complication of using our model with a SQL database,
let's test it out using the same in-memory implementation we used
before::

	def DryRun():
		doc=LoadMetadata()
		container=InMemoryEntityContainer(doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather'])
		weatherData=doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather.DataPoints']
		weatherNotes=doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather.Notes']
		LoadData(weatherData,SAMPLE_DIR)
		LoadNotes(weatherNotes,'weathernotes.txt',weatherData)
		return doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather']

SAMPLE_DIR here is the name of a directory containing data from the
weather station.  The implementation of the LoadData function is fairly
ordinary, parsing the daily text files from the station and adding them
to the DataPoints entity set.

The implementation of the LoadNotes function is more interesting as it
demonstrates use of the API for binding entities together using
navigation properties::

	def LoadNotes(weatherNotes,fileName,weatherData):
		with open(fileName,'r') as f:
			id=1
			with weatherNotes.OpenCollection() as collection, weatherData.OpenCollection() as data:
				while True:
					line=f.readline()
					if len(line)==0:
						break
					elif line[0]=='#':
						continue
					noteWords=line.split()
					if noteWords:
						note=collection.new_entity()
						note['ID'].set_from_value(id)
						start=iso.TimePoint(
							date=iso.Date.from_str(noteWords[0]),
							time=iso.Time(hour=0,minute=0,second=0))
						note['StartDate'].set_from_value(start)
						end=iso.TimePoint(
							date=iso.Date.from_str(noteWords[1]).Offset(days=1),
							time=iso.Time(hour=0,minute=0,second=0))
						note['EndDate'].set_from_value(end)
						note['Details'].set_from_value(string.join(noteWords[2:],' '))
						collection.insert_entity(note)
						# now find the data points that match
						data.set_filter(core.CommonExpression.from_str("TimePoint ge datetime'%s' and TimePoint lt datetime'%s'"%(unicode(start),unicode(end))))
						for dataPoint in data.values():
							dataPoint['Note'].BindEntity(note)
							data.update_entity(dataPoint)
						id=id+1
		with weatherNotes.OpenCollection() as collection:
			collection.set_orderby(core.CommonExpression.OrderByFromString('StartDate desc'))
			for e in collection.itervalues():
				with e['DataPoints'].OpenCollection() as affectedData:
					print "%s-%s: %s (%i data points affected)"%(unicode(e['StartDate'].value),
						unicode(e['EndDate'].value),e['Details'].value,len(affectedData))

The function opens collections for both Notes and DataPoints.  For each
uncommented line in the source file it creates a new Note entity, then,
it adds a filter to the collection of data points that narrows down the
collection to all the data points affected by the note and then iterates
through them binding the note to the data point and updating the entity
(to commit the change to the data source).  Here's a sample of the
output on a dry-run of a small sample of the data from November 2007::

	2007-12-25T00:00:00-2008-01-03T00:00:00: All sensors inaccurate (0 data points affected)
	2007-11-01T00:00:00-2007-11-23T00:00:00: rain sensor over reporting rainfall following malfunction (49 data points affected)

You may wonder why we use the values function, rather than itervalues in
the loop that updates the data points.  itervalues would certainly have
been more efficient but, just like native Python dictionaries, it is a
bad idea to modify the data source when iterating as unpredictable
things may happen.  The concept is extended by this API to cover the
entire container: a thread should not modify the container while
iterating through a collection.

Of course, this API has been designed for parallel use so there is
always the chance that another thread or process is modifying the data
source outside of your control.  Behaviour in that case is left to be
implementation dependent - storage engines have widely differing
policies on what to do in these cases.

If you have large amounts of data to iterate through you should consider
using list(collection.iterpage(True)) instead.  For a SQL data souurce
this has the disadvantage of executing a new query for each page rather
than spooling data from a single SELECT but it provides control over
page size (and hence memory usage in your client) and is robust to
modifications.

	As an aside, if you change the call from values to itervalues in
	the sample you may well discover a bug in the SQLite driver in
	Python 2.7. The bug means that a commit on a database connection
	while you are fetching data on another cursor causes subsequent data
	access commands to fail.  It's a bit technical, but the details are
	here: http://bugs.python.org/issue10513

Having tested the model using the in-memory provider we can implement a
full test using the SQL back-end we created in MakeContainer above. 
This test function prints the 30 strongest wind gusts in the database,
along with any linked note::

	def TestModel(drop=False):
		doc=LoadMetadata()
		container=MakeContainer(doc,drop)
		weatherData=doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather.DataPoints']
		weatherNotes=doc.root.DataServices['WeatherSchema.CambridgeWeather.Notes']
		if drop:
			LoadData(weatherData,SAMPLE_DIR)
			LoadNotes(weatherNotes,'weathernotes.txt',weatherData)
		with weatherData.OpenCollection() as collection:
			collection.set_orderby(core.CommonExpression.OrderByFromString('WindSpeedMax desc'))
			collection.set_page(30)
			for e in collection.iterpage():
				note=e['Note'].GetEntity()
				if e['WindSpeedMax'] and e['Pressure']:
					print "%s: Pressure %imb, max wind speed %0.1f knots (%0.1f mph); %s"%(unicode(e['TimePoint'].value),
						e['Pressure'].value,e['WindSpeedMax'].value,e['WindSpeedMax'].value*1.15078,
						note['Details'] if note is not None else "")

Here's some sample output::

	>>> weather.TestModel()
	2002-10-27T10:30:00: Pressure 988mb, max wind speed 74.0 knots (85.2 mph); 
	2004-03-20T15:30:00: Pressure 993mb, max wind speed 72.0 knots (82.9 mph); 
	2007-01-18T14:30:00: Pressure 984mb, max wind speed 70.0 knots (80.6 mph); 
	... [ and so on ]
	...
	2007-01-11T10:30:00: Pressure 998mb, max wind speed 58.0 knots (66.7 mph); 
	2007-01-18T07:30:00: Pressure 980mb, max wind speed 58.0 knots (66.7 mph); 
	1996-02-18T04:30:00: Pressure 998mb, max wind speed 56.0 knots (64.4 mph); humidity and dewpoint readings may be inaccurate, particularly high humidity readings
	2000-12-13T01:30:00: Pressure 991mb, max wind speed 56.0 knots (64.4 mph); 
	2002-10-27T13:00:00: Pressure 996mb, max wind speed 56.0 knots (64.4 mph); 
	2004-01-31T17:30:00: Pressure 983mb, max wind speed 56.0 knots (64.4 mph); 

Notice that the reading from 1996 has a related note.


Step 4: Link the Data Source to the OData Server
------------------------------------------------

This data set is designed to be updated by some offline process that
polls the weather station for the latest readings and adds them to the
database behind the scenes.  Unlike the memory-cache example, the OData
interface should be read-only so we use the
:py:class:`~pyslet.odata2.server.ReadOnlyServer` sub-class of the OData
server::

	def runWeatherServer(weatherApp=None):
		"""Starts the web server running"""
		server=make_server('',SERVICE_PORT,weatherApp)
		logging.info("HTTP server on port %i running"%SERVICE_PORT)
		# Respond to requests until process is killed
		server.serve_forever()

	def main():
		"""Executed when we are launched"""
		doc=LoadMetadata()
		container=MakeContainer(doc)
		server=ReadOnlyServer(serviceRoot=SERVICE_ROOT)
		server.SetModel(doc)
		t=threading.Thread(target=runWeatherServer,kwargs={'weatherApp':server})
		t.setDaemon(True)
		t.start()
		logging.info("Starting HTTP server on %s"%SERVICE_ROOT)
		t.join()

Once the script is running we test in a browser.  I've loaded the full data set into
the server, how many data points?  Here's how we can find out, in our browser we
go to::

	http://localhost:8080/DataPoints/$count

The result is 325213.  Firefox recognises that the feeds are in Atom format and
renders the feed customisations we made earlier.

.. image:: /images/temperatures.png

When we access this page with logging turned up to INFO we get the
following output on the console, interspersed with the simple HTTP
server output::

	INFO:root:SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "DataPoints"; []
	127.0.0.1 - - [21/Feb/2014 22:57:01] "GET /DataPoints/$count HTTP/1.1" 200 6
	INFO:root:SELECT "TimePoint", "Temperature", "Humidity", "DewPoint", "Pressure", "WindSpeed", "WindDirection", "WindSpeedMax", "SunRainStart", "Sun", "Rain", "Temperature" AS o_1, "TimePoint" FROM "DataPoints" ORDER BY o_1 DESC, "TimePoint" ASC; []
	127.0.0.1 - - [21/Feb/2014 22:57:18] "GET /DataPoints?$orderby=Temperature%20desc&$top=30 HTTP/1.1" 200 31006

You may wonder what those square brackets are doing at the end of the
SQL statements. They're actually used for logging the parameter values
when the query has been parameterised.  If we add a filter you'll see
what they do::

	http://localhost:8080/DataPoints?$filter=Temperature%20gt%20-100&$orderby=Temperature%20asc&$top=30

And here's the output on the console::

	INFO:root:SELECT "TimePoint", "Temperature", "Humidity", "DewPoint", "Pressure", "WindSpeed", "WindDirection", "WindSpeedMax", "SunRainStart", "Sun", "Rain", "Temperature" AS o_1, "TimePoint" FROM "DataPoints" WHERE ("Temperature" > ?) ORDER BY o_1 DESC, "TimePoint" ASC; [-100]
	127.0.0.1 - - [21/Feb/2014 16:35:09] "GET /DataPoints?$filter=Temperature%20gt%20-100&$orderby=Temperature%20desc&$top=30 HTTP/1.1" 200 31006

Yes, all Pyslet queries are fully parameterized for security and performance!
