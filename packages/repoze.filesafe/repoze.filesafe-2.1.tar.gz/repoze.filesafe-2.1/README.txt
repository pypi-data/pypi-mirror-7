``repoze.filesafe`` README
==========================

repoze.filesafe provides utilities methods to handle creation
of files on the filesystem safely by integrating with the ZODB package's
transaction manager.  It can be used in combination with repoze.tm (or
repoze.tm2) for use in WSGI environments.


See ``docs/index.rst`` for documentation.
