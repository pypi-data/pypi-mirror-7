=====

Python bindings for Fast Artificial Neural Networks 2.2.0 (FANN 2.2.0).


DESCRIPTION
===========

 This is a python binding for Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN 2.2.0) that implements multilayer
artificial neural networks with support for both fully connected
and sparsely connected networks. It includes a framework for easy
handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well
documented, and fast.

FANN 2.2.0 source:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fann/files/fann/2.2.0/FANN-2.2.0-Source.zip/download


INSTALLATION
============

You can install fann2 from pypi, using either pip or easy_install:

```
$ pip install fann2
```
or
```
$ easy_install fann2
```


USAGE
=====
Just 

```
>> from fann2 import libfann 
```

and then create libfann.neural_net and libfann.training_data objects

```
>> ann = libfann.neural_net()
>> train_data = libfann.training_data()
```

Look at the examples at the FANN documentation and its 
C++ bindings for further reference.
