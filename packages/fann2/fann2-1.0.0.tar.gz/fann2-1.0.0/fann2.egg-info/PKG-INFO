Description: fann2
        =====
        
        Python bindings for Fast Artificial Neural Networks 2.2.0 (FANN 2.2.0).
        
        
        DESCRIPTION
        ===========
        
         This is a python binding for Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN 2.2.0) that implements multilayer
        artificial neural networks with support for both fully connected
        and sparsely connected networks. It includes a framework for easy
        handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well
        documented, and fast.
        
        FANN 2.2.0 source:
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/fann/files/fann/2.2.0/FANN-2.2.0-Source.zip/download
        
        
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        You can install fann2 from pypi, using either pip or easy_install:
        
        ```
        $ pip install fann2
        ```
        or
        ```
        $ easy_install fann2
        ```
        
        
        USAGE
        =====
        Just 
        
        ```
        >> from fann2 import libfann 
        ```
        
        and then create libfann.neural_net and libfann.training_data objects
        
        ```
        >> ann = libfann.neural_net()
        >> train_data = libfann.training_data()
        ```
        
        Look at the examples at the FANN documentation and its 
        C++ bindings for further reference.
