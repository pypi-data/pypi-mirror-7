.. moduleauthor:: Chris Dusold <PySpeedup@chrisdusold.com>

A module containing fast implementations of algorithms.

The motivation for this module was a mix between helper functions for Project
Euler solutions, and both in cryptography and discrete math investigations.

.. todo:: This is all either examples or to build up to the prime factorization
          class which I intend to build.
