1.1.0 - July 31st, 2014
=======================

ADDED:  OpenCage geocoder added. Contributed by Demeter Sztanko.

ADDED:  `geopy.geocoders.get_geocoder_for_service` allows library authors
        to dynamically get a geocoder.

FIXED:  YahooPlacefinder bugs causing geocoding failure.

FIXED:  LiveAddress API URL updated.

FIXED:  Location.__repr__ unicode encode error in Python 2.7.

CHANGED:    `geopy.geocoders` modules now strictly declare their exports.


1.0.1 - July 24th, 2014
=======================

FIXED:  The Baidu Maps geocoder's `_check_status` method used a Python
        2-specific print statement.


1.0.0 - July 23rd, 2014
=======================

ADDED:  Baidu Maps geocoder added. Contributed by Risent.

ADDED:  Nominatim geocoder now supports structured queries. Contributed
        by kpanic.

ADDED:  Nominatim geocoder now supports a `language` parameter. Contributed
        by Benjamin Henne.

CHANGED:    GoogleV3's `geocode` and `reverse` methods have different
            orders for keyword argument parameters. Geocoders are now
            standardized on `(query, exactly_one, timeout, ...)`.

FIXED:  Removed rounding of minutes which was causing a formatted point
        to always have zero seconds. Contributed by Jonathan Batchelor.


0.99 - March 18, 2014
=====================

ADDED:  GeocodeFarm geocoder added with support for geocoding and reverse
        geocoding. Contributed by Eric Palakovich Carr.


0.98.3 - March 7, 2014
======================

ADDED:  Queries are encoded as unicode in Python 2.7 by the geocoder.
        Contributed by Rocky Meza.

FIXED:  YahooPlaceFinder `count` parameter fixed.

FIXED: Point.__repr__ fixed. Contributed by Paweł Mandera.


0.98.2 - February 28, 2014
==========================

ADDED:  GoogleV3 now accepts an `api_key` parameter. Contributed
        by Andrea Tosatto.

CHANGED: GoogleV3's deprecated `protocol` argument has been removed.


0.98.1 - February 22, 2014
==========================

FIXED:  Mapquest geocoder did not use format_string in the creation
        of its queries. Contributed by Danny Finkelstein.

FIXED:  Geocoders incorrectly raised a GeocoderTimedOut exception for all
        `SSLError` exceptions. Contributed by David Gilman.


0.98 - February 5, 2014
=======================

CHANGED: Geocoders' `geocode` and `reverse` method return types have changed
         from None, a tuple, or a list of tuples, to None, a `geopy.Location`
         object, or a list of `geopy.Location` objects.

        `Location` objects can be iterated over the same as
        the previous tuples for backwards compatibility, returning
        (address<String>, (latitude<float>, longitude<Float)).

        `geopy.Location` objects also make returned data available as
        properties. Existing attributes are `address`, `longitude`, and
        `latitude`. Now available are the geocoder's raw response as `raw`,
        and the location's altitude as `altitude`.


0.97.1 - February 1, 2014
=========================

FIXED: YahooPlaceFinder geocoder authentication and response parsing fixed.
       Contributed by petergx.

ADDED: GoogleV3 geocoding now supports a `components` parameter, which
       is a filter for location criteria such as administrative area,
       country, etc. Contributed by crccheck.


0.97 - December 26, 2013
========================

CHANGED:    SSL connections are used by default for services with support.
            These geocoders accept a new 'scheme' argument in their init,
            which may be 'https' or 'http'. Users desiring unencrypted
            connections must now specify 'http'. Note that SSL connections'
            certificates are not verified.

CHANGED:    Geocoders accept a `timeout` argument which specifies the number of
            seconds to wait before raising a `GeocoderTimedOut` exception. This
            can be specified in the init, or specified one-off in each `geocode`
            or `reverse` call. There is now a default of 1 second.

CHANGED:    geopy now supports Python 2 and Python 3 on a single codebase.
            Support for Python 2.5 is also dropped.

CHANGED:    GoogleV3's `protocol` argument is deprecated in favor of `scheme`.

ADDED:  ESRI's ArcGIS geocoder implemented. Contributed by Arsen Mamikonyan.

ADDED:  Geocoders accept a `proxies` argument which specifies a proxy to
        route its geocoder requests through. It uses urllib, and accepts
        proxies in the form of a dictionary of {scheme: proxy address}, e.g.,
        {"https": "192.0.2.0"}. This was present but undocumented in 0.96.

ADDED:  Geocoders check a new method, `_geocoder_exception_handler`, if
        defined, when the HTTP call to the geocoder's service raises an
        exception. See LiveStreets for an example. Users can define or
        override this method.

ADDED:  LiveStreets throws a `GeocoderQuotaExceeded` exception when
        appropriate.

ADDED:  `Point` can parse a greater variety of coordinate strings. Contributed
        by nucflash.

FIXED:  GeocodersDotUS now authenticates with an `Authorization` HTTP header.
        Contributed by Arsen Mamikonyan.

REMOVED:    MediaWiki and SemanticMediaWiki geocoders removed.

REMOVED:    Geohash module has been removed.


0.96.3 - December 26, 2013
==========================

ADDED:  Documentation warning that the Vincenty distance implementation fails
        to converge for some valid points. Reported by mkeller-upb.

FIXED:  Geocoder proxying fixed. Contributed by Marc-Olivier Titeux.


0.96.2 - November 20, 2013
==========================

FIXED:  MANIFEST.in exclusions broke builds under `buildout`. Contributed by
        James Mills.


0.96.1 - October 31, 2013
=========================

FIXED:  GoogleV3 returns `None` when the service returns an error status of
        `ZERO_RESULTS`. Contributed by Ian A Wilson.


0.96 - October 25, 2013
=======================

CHANGED:    GoogleV3's reverse geocoder now returns one result by default. Set
            `exactly_one` to False for a list.

CHANGED:    GoogleV3 returns new exception types:
                `geopy.geocoders.base.GQueryError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQueryError`
                `geopy.geocoders.base.GeocoderResultError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQueryError`
                `geopy.geocoders.base.GTooManyQueriesError` -> `geopy.exc.GeocoderQuotaExceeded`

ADDED:  OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoder implemented. Contributed by
        Alessandro Pasotti.

ADDED:  Yahoo! BOSS Geo PlaceFinder geocoder implemented. Contributed by
        jhmaddox and Philip Kimmey.

ADDED:  SmartyStreets LiveAddress geocoder implemented. Contributed by
        Michael Whatcott.

ADDED:  GeoNames geocoder is implements GeoNames' new username
        requirement and `api.geonames.org` endpoint. Contributed by David
        Wilson and Benoit Grégoire.

ADDED:  Bing geocoder supports `user_location` (`Point`) parameter. Bing will
        prefer results near the coordinates of `user_location`. Contributed by
        Ryan Nagle.

FIXED:  `GoogleV3.geocode_first()` no longer throws exception on multiple
        results. Contributed by migajek.

FIXED:  Unnecessary coercing to UTF-8 on Py3k. Contributed by akanouras.

FIXED: `format_degrees` now rounds minutes properly. Contributed by avdd.

FIXED:  No longer warn if the optional dependency `BeautifulSoup` is
        not present.

FIXED:  Miscellaneous inconsistent behavior and errors in geolocating.

REMOVED:    Google V2 geocoder has been removed as its API was shutdown.


0.95.1 - March 22, 2013
=======================

FIXED:   Fix #12, where `DeprecationWarning` was showing for GoogleV2 even if
         it wasn't being used (due to `geopy.geocoders` importing it).
         Contributed by Dave Arter.

CHANGED: `GoogleV3.geocode` "address" kwarg renamed to "string" to match
         `Google.geocode` to make updating easier.

FIXED:   Geocoders now properly handle Unicode objects as input (previously
         would fail on non-ASCII characters due to wanting UTF-8 strings).


0.95 - March 12, 2013
=====================

ADDED:   Google Geocoding API V3 support. Contributed by Jordan Bouvier
         (jbouvier). "google.Google()" should be replaced by
         "googlev3.GoogleV3()", with no `api_key`.

         Please see http://goo.gl/somDT for valid arguments.

UPDATED: setup.py updated to now automatically support Python 3+ (via 2to3
         auto-compile option). Contributed by Feanil Patel.


0.94.2 - March 12, 2012
=======================

ADDED:   MANIFEST.in so that LICENSE file gets included in dist packages
         (per req by Debian Python Module Team)

UPDATED: Yahoo geocoder uses new PlaceFinder API instead of outdated
         MapsService V1 API.


0.94.1 - March 24, 2011
=======================

ADDED:   Test suite includes geocoding tests for the Google, Bing, Yahoo,
         GeocoderDotUS, and GeoNames geocoders.

CHANGED: `output_format` is deprecated in backends that used it.

FIXED:   Bing geocoder now works properly. Updated to use the JSON return
         method rather than XML. `output_format` has always been ignored
         and is now deprecated.

FIXED:   GeocoderDotUS now works properly. Updated to use more compact CSV
         return method rather than XMLRPC.

CHANGED: Yahoo geocoder now uses the "old" tuple return format
         (address, (lat, lon)) rather than the undocumented Location()
         object, for API consistency. (Object return values with rich
         data will be implemented in a future release.)

FIXED:   Issue 40. Fixed "print" statement in Bing backend. No more
         print statements remain.

FIXED:   Issue 39. In addition to checking for system `json` and `simplejson`,
         geopy now looks for a system-installed `django` (which bundles a
         copy of simplejson).

FIXED:   Issue 45. Implement __cmp__ on Distance so that distance objects may
         be compared against one another.

CHANGED: Added __repr__ and __str__ to Distance

ADDED:   Issue 46. Geocoder backend for MapQuest's OpenMapQuest API,
         contributed by Shashwat Anand.


0.94 - March 7, 2010
====================

ADDED: Partial test suite can now be run via "setup.py test"

FIXED: Issue 5. Converted "print" statements to logger calls to
       allow compatibility with WSGI.

FIXED: Issue 16. Google geocoder backend now throws more descriptive
       exceptions on certain failure statuses.

FIXED: Issue 18. Add simplejson to install_requires for setup. Use
       native (Python 2.6+/3.0+) json module if available.

FIXED: Issue 21 and Issue 25. Distance calculations for values beyond
       180/-180 and 90/-90 now wrap instead of raising an error.

FIXED: Issue 22. Fixed string representation of Point objects so
       that they don't throw an exception.

FIXED: Issue 23. Fixed GreatCircleDistance ValueErrors due to floating
       point precision on extremely close points.


Changes between 0.93 (October 8, 2006) and February 15, 2009
