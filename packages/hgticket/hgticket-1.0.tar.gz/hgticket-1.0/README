**Mercurial extension to detect JIRA-style ticket number in a commit message**

We have a policy of linking every commit to a ticket, for traceability. 
But we are humans, and we tend to forget, while rushing to release a new awesome app.
So we made this ridiculous extension to get our back covered. 

Heavily inspired from Iain Lowe's hgspellcheck extension (https://bitbucket.org/ilowe/hgspellcheck)
