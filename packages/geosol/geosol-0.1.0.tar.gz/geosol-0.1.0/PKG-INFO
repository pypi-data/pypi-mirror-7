Description: =======================
        Geometry Problem Solver
        =======================
        
        Geometry Problem Solver (geosol) automatically solves a geometry problem 
        consisting of question text and a diagram.
        
        Geosol is consisted of largely 3 processes:
        1. Textual understanding
        2. Diagram understanding
        3. Geometric inference
        
        Please see below for detailed explanations.
        Typical usage often looks like this:
        
        import geosol.txt as gtxt	# modules for (1)
        import geosol.dgm as gdgm	# modules for (2)
        import geosol.inf as ginf	# modules for (3)
        
        img = gdgm.open("diagram.png")
        qt = gtxt.open("question.txt")
        txt_rep = gtxt.rep(qt) # abstract representation of question text
        dgm_rep = gdgm.rep(img, txt_rep) # rep of diagram
        inf_mod = ginf.inf(dgm_rep, txt_rep) # inference module
        print(inf_mod.get_answer())
        
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Standard Python packages to be installed (via pip) are:
        numpy, scipy, pillow, scikit-learn, tinyocr
        
        Please note that tinyocr is an OCR package built 
        by the same author. OCR being a distinct function itself,
        it has been separately packaged.
        
        In addition, OpenCV and Python wrapper needs to be
        installed. Please visit the opencv web page.
        The author has version 2.4.
