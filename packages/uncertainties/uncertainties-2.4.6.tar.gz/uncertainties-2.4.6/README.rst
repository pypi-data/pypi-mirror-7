GitHub
------

The current version of the ``master*`` branches in the Github
repository are bleeding-edge, but they are *working* versions that
passed the tests for all versions of Python starting at 2.4.

The ``master`` branch is for Python 2.6+ (and Python 3+ through 
``2to3``), while the ``master_python2.3`` branch is for Python 2.3 to 
2.5.

Other branches might be present in the GitHub repository, but they are 
temporary and represent work in progress that does not necessarily run 
properly yet.
