        Overview.

        collective.carousel is the package that lets you add "carousels" of items in
        your Plone site. More than one carousels on one page are supported.
        
        collective.carousel is based on `Scrollable`__ plugin for `JQuery Tools
        library`__.

        How to get a carousel?
        ======================
        
        Work of carousel is based on one assumption |---| you already have a
        collection that returns results for showing in the carousel.
        
        Carousel can be added in 2 ways:
        
            * as a viewlet above page's title (content carousel);
            * as a portlet to any portlet manager in your site.
        
        Carousel above page's title (Content carousel).
        -----------------------------------------------
        
            * Go to ``Edit`` tab on a page where you want to add a carousel;
            * go to ``Settings``;
            * add a collection that will provide content for carousel to ``Carousel
              object`` field;
            * if you want to add more than one carousel, add more collections to the
              same field;
            * after saving your page, you should see the carousel(s) above your page's
              title if the collection(s) you chose for the carousel(s) returns any
              elements.
        
        Carousel in a portlet.
        ----------------------
        
            * On a page where you want to add a carousel click ``Manage portlets`` in
              one of the columns of your site;
            * choose ``Carousel portlet`` from ``Add portlet...`` menu;
            * collection portlet is a derivative from standard collection portlet in
              Plone, hence the same fields are available for this type of portlets as
              well;
            * fill out the fields in the form specifying a collection that will
              provide content for the carousel portlet.
        
        **NOTE** content carousels are not inheritable while carousel portlet is
        inheritable as any other portlet in a Plone site. This means that when you add
        a content carousel to a folder, the same carousel will not be shown on any
        object within that folder. At the same time if you add a carousel portlet on a
        folder, that portlet will be shown for all objects within the folder that
        don't explicitly block parent portlets.
        
        Tips
        ====
        
        What if I want to move carousel to another place?
        -------------------------------------------------
        Content carousel is defined with a regular viewlet. This lets you to move that
        viewlet to any place in your site the same way you would do with any other
        viewlet. Read `Moving a viewlet from a viewlet manager to another one`__ for
        more info on how to move viewlets from one viewlet manager to another.
        
          .. __: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/customizing-main-template-viewlets/moving-a-viewlet/
        
        How do I customize carousel's view?
        -----------------------------------
        collective.carousel provides a flexible way of customizing the look of items,
        shown in a carousel based on a content type of the item. collective.carousel
        comes with 2 bundled views that are available for items, rendered in a
        carousel:
        
          * `browser/templates/news_item_tile.pt` |---| defines how News Items should
            be rendered in a carousel;
          * `browser/templates/default_tile.pt` |---| how all the rest content types
            should be rendered in a carousel.
        
        If you need to either override one of the existing views or define a new view
        for any content type you can do this from your package using ZCML
        registartion. Please take a look at `browser/configure.zcml` and
        `testing.zcml` for examples of such registrations. Note that there are pages
        with 2 different names:
        
          * `carousel-view` |---| defines a view for a content type in content
            carousel;
          * `carousel-portlet-view` |---| the view for a content type when shown in a
            carousel portlet.
        
        So if you need to override/register a view for any specific content type for
        content carousel, your `<browser:page />` has to have `carousel-view` name. In
        case you want to override/register a view for carousel portlet, name should be
        `carousel-portlet-view`.
        
        I need to do something once the carousel is fully loaded.
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        The simplest use-case |---| you have some content carousels placed in a row
        side by side. Most probably your carousels have different heights and that
        doesn't look nice when they are placed side by side. So you want to equalize
        the heights of these carousels with Javascript so that your carousels have the
        same height. Since collective.carousel already binds ``load()`` event to each
        carousel (resizing the carousel to fit all of it's content) you can not bind
        one more ``load()`` event to a carousel because due to the nature of
        ``load()`` event it might be fired too early when not all content of a
        carousel is loaded.
        
        For the cases like this collective.carousel provides custom Javascript event
        ``resized.carousel`` that you can attach your special handlers to. Moreover
        each carousel returns it's height that can be accessed in ``resized.carousel``
        event.
        
        Here is a simple code snippet of how to adjust the heights of carousels with
        JQuery::
        
            $("#my-container .carousel").bind('resized.carousel', function(event, newheight) {
                $("#my-container .carousel").each(function() {
                    if ($(this).height() < newheight) $(this).height(newheight);
                });
            });
