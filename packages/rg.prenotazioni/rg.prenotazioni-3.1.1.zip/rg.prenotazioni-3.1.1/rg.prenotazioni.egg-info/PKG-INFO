        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product introduces two new `content types`_ to your Plone site:
        
        .. _content types: http://developer.plone.org/content/types.html
        
        - `Booking`
        - `Booking Folder`
        
        Booking content
        ---------------
        
        **Booking** is a `content type` used to store information about reservation.
        
        The product interface provides a way to add new booking elements,
        by clicking on one of the plus signs available in the slots calendar
        as shown below:

          :alt: The view of Booking Folder
        
        Each booking element once created is storerd into its own **Booking Folder**.
        
        
        Booking Folder content
        ----------------------
        
        **Booking Folder** is a folderish content type which store your **Booking** objects.
        It is therefore possible to have more of an "agenda".
        
        Using rg.prenotazioni
        =====================
        
        
        Creating a new booking folder content
        -------------------------------------
        
        If the product is correctly installed the **booking folder** entry is available on the `add new` action menu.
        Click on it to add a new booking folder content.
        
        .. figure:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/rg.prenotazioni/add-folder-content-entry.png/image_preview
          :alt: The view of Booking Folder
        
        Saving the form a new booking folder will be created.
        
        Here below the edit page:
        
        .. figure:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/rg.prenotazioni/booking-folder-form.png/image_preview
          :alt: The view of Booking Folder
        
        
        Since version **2.1** new functionalities has been added to the folder
        configuration:
        
        - more then one gate can be handled
        - booking vacations supports also bookings with no gate assigned
        
        Since version **3.0** the agenda has:
        - a new user interface
        - allows custom duration for booking types
        
        Creating a new booking content
        ------------------------------
        
        Anonymous and authenticated users are allowed to add new booking content
        by clicking on the plus signs on the default booking folder view.
        
        .. figure:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/rg.prenotazioni/default-view.png/image_preview
          :alt: Link to create new entry
        
        After its creation the slot will be displayed as "busy" for anonymous user
        and the slot won't be available anymore.
        
        Back-end user can see and manage the reservation
        according with its Plone rights.
        
        Here below a screenshot of the edit page:
        
        .. figure:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/rg.prenotazioni/add-bomking-form.png/image_preview
          :alt: The view of Booking Folder
        
        Since version **2.1**:
        - captcha has been added for anonymous users.
        - booking content can be added only from the view folder links.
        - booking can't be added in the past anymore.
        
        
        Workflow
        --------
        
        The product comes with its own workflow "prenotazioni_workflow".
        
        Since versione **2.1** a new states has been added.
        Here below a list of all the states available:
        
        **Private**: booking object initial state:
        
        * `submit` (Automatic transition to pending)
        
        **Pending**
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `publish` (to published)
        * `refuse` (to refused)
        
        **Published**
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `refuse` (to refused)
        
        **Refused**
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `restore` (to pending)
        
        Managers can confirm a Booking using workflow transitions.
        The workflow transition triggers an email to be sent to the booker (see below).
        
        
        Content Rules (mail notifications)
        ----------------------------------
        
        There are additional content rules that can be used to notify booking owner when his booking has been accepted
        or re-scheduled.
        
        Rules **are not automatically** as of version **3.x**. They are imported by a separate generic setup profile.
        
        There's also a rule that can warn the Booking Folder responsible when new booking are created, but you need to
        manually enable it on folders.
