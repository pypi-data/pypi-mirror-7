.SH SYNOPSIS
genxword3-gtk
.SH DESCRIPTION
Genxword3-gtk is a crossword generator, which produces pdf (A4 or letter size) 
versions of the grid and clues, or png / svg versions of the crossword grid, 
together with a text file containing the words and clues.
The word list that is used to create the crossword is also saved as a text file.
.PP
The word list can be created when using genxword3-gtk, or it can be a text file 
that has already been written. It can contain words and clues, or just words.
Each word, or word and clue, should be on a separate line, and there should 
be a space between the word and clue. In the following example, the word is 'excalibur'
and the clue is 'The sword that a moistened bint lobbed at Arthur':

Example word lists can be found in the /usr/share/genxword3/word_lists/ directory.

There is also an option to sort the word list by word length, which might be useful 
when editing a long word list. This option also removes words with non-alphabetic characters.
