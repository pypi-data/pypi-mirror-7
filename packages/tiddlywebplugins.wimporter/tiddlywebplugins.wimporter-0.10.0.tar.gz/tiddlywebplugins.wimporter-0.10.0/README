TiddlyWeb plugin for server-side import of tiddlers from a TiddlyWiki
into a selected bag.

A form hosted at {server_prefix}/import provides an interface for
uploading a tiddlywiki by URL or file (from local disk). The tiddlers
in that wiki will be loaded into a temporary bag. An interface is
then provided to select from those tiddlers a subset to be installed
into a target bag.
