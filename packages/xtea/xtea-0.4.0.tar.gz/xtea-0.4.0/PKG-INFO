Description: ===========
        Python XTEA
        ===========
        
            This is an XTEA-Cipher implementation in Python (eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm).
        
            XTEA is a blockcipher with 8 bytes blocksize and 16 bytes Keysize (128-Bit).
            The algorithm is secure at 2014 with the recommend 64 rounds (32 cycles). This
            implementation supports following modes of operation:
            ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR
        	
            It also supports CBC-MAC.
        
        
        Example:
        
            >>> from xtea import *
            >>> key = " "*16  # Never use this
            >>> text = "This is a text. "*8
            >>> x = new(key, mode=MODE_OFB, IV="12345678")
            >>> c = x.encrypt(text)
            >>> text == x.decrypt(c)
            True
            
        Note
        ====
           
            I does NOT guarantee that this implementation (or the base cipher) is secure. If there are bugs, tell me them please.
