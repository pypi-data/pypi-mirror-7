Features
========

|PyPI version| |License| |Wheel| |Downloads|

Features is a simple implementation of **feature set algebra** in Python.

Linguistic analyses commonly use sets of **binary or privative features** to
refer to different groups of linguistic objects: for example a group of
*phonemes* that share some phonological features like ``[-consonantal, +high]``
or a set of *morphemes* that occur in context of a specific person/number
combination like ``[-participant, GROUP]``. Usually, the features are applied in
a way such that only **some of their combinations are valid**, while others are
impossible (i.e. refer to no object) |--| for example ``[+high, +low]``, or
``[-participant, +speaker]``.

With this package, such feature systems can be defined with a simple contingency
**table definition** (feature matrix) and stored under a section name in a
simple clear-text **configuration file**. Each feature system can then be
**loaded** by its name and provides its own ``FeatureSet`` subclass that
implements all **comparisons and operations** between its feature sets according
to the given definition (compatibility, entailment, intersection, unification,
etc.).

Features creates the **complete lattice** structure between the possible feature
sets of each feature system and lets you navigate and **visualize their
relations** using the Graphviz_ graph layout library.


Installation
------------

This package runs under Python 2.7 and 3.3+, use pip_ to install:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install features

This will also install the concepts_ package from PyPI providing the `Formal
Concept Analysis`_ (FCA) algorithms on which this package is based.

Features is essentially a convenience wrapper around the FCA-functionality of
concepts.


Systems
-------

Features includes some **predefined feature systems** that you can try out
immediately. To load a feature system, pass its **name** to
``features.FeatureSystem``:

.. code:: python

    >>> import features

    >>> fs = features.FeatureSystem('plural')

    >>> fs
    <FeatureSystem('plural') of 6 atoms 22 featuresets>

The built-in feature systems are defined in the ``config.ini`` file in the
package directory (usually, this will be ``Lib/site-packages/concepts`` in your
Python directory).

The definition of a feature system is stored in its ``context`` object:

.. code:: python

    >>> print(fs.context)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <Context object mapping 6 objects to 10 properties at 0x...>
          |+1|-1|+2|-2|+3|-3|+sg|+pl|-sg|-pl|
        1s|X |  |  |X |  |X |X  |   |   |X  |
        1p|X |  |  |X |  |X |   |X  |X  |   |
        2s|  |X |X |  |  |X |X  |   |   |X  |
        2p|  |X |X |  |  |X |   |X  |X  |   |
        3s|  |X |  |X |X |  |X  |   |   |X  |
        3p|  |X |  |X |X |  |   |X  |X  |   |

    >>> fs.context.objects
    ('1s', '1p', '2s', '2p', '3s', '3p')

    >>> fs.context.properties
    ('+1', '-1', '+2', '-2', '+3', '-3', '+sg', '+pl', '-sg', '-pl')

    >>> fs.context.bools  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, False, True),
     (True, False, False, True, False, True, False, True, True, False),
     (False, True, True, False, False, True, True, False, False, True),
     (False, True, True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False),
     (False, True, False, True, True, False, True, False, False, True),
     (False, True, False, True, True, False, False, True, True, False)]

It basically provies a mapping from objects to features and vice versa. Check
the documentation of concepts_ for further information on its full
functionality.

.. code:: python

    >>> fs.context.intension(['1s', '1p'])  # common features?
    ('+1', '-2', '-3')

    >>> fs.context.extension(['-3', '+sg'])  # common objects?
    ('1s', '2s')


Feature sets
------------

All feature system contain a **contradicting feature set** with all features
that refers to no object:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs.infimum
    FeatureSet('+1 -1 +2 -2 +3 -3 +sg +pl -sg -pl')

    >>> fs.infimum.concept.extent
    ()

As well as a maximally general **tautological feature set** with no features
referring to all objects:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs.supremum
    FeatureSet('')

    >>> fs.supremum.concept.extent
    ('1s', '1p', '2s', '2p', '3s', '3p')

Use the feature system to iterate over **all defined feature sets** in shortlex
extent order:

.. code:: python

    >>> for f in fs:
    ...     print('%s %s' % (f, f.concept.extent))
    [+1 -1 +2 -2 +3 -3 +sg +pl -sg -pl] ()
    [+1 +sg] ('1s',)
    [+1 +pl] ('1p',)
    [+2 +sg] ('2s',)
    [+2 +pl] ('2p',)
    [+3 +sg] ('3s',)
    [+3 +pl] ('3p',)
    [+1] ('1s', '1p')
    [-3 +sg] ('1s', '2s')
    [-2 +sg] ('1s', '3s')
    [-3 +pl] ('1p', '2p')
    [-2 +pl] ('1p', '3p')
    [+2] ('2s', '2p')
    [-1 +sg] ('2s', '3s')
    [-1 +pl] ('2p', '3p')
    [+3] ('3s', '3p')
    [+sg] ('1s', '2s', '3s')
    [+pl] ('1p', '2p', '3p')
    [-3] ('1s', '1p', '2s', '2p')
    [-2] ('1s', '1p', '3s', '3p')
    [-1] ('2s', '2p', '3s', '3p')
    [] ('1s', '1p', '2s', '2p', '3s', '3p')

The **string representations** will show the smallest possible notation for
each feature set by default (shortlex minimum). The full representation is also
available (and an extent-based representation):

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('1sg').string
    '+1 +sg'

    >>> fs('1sg').string_maximal
    '+1 -2 -3 +sg -pl'

    >>> fs('1sg').string_extent
    '1s'

To use the maximal representation for ``__str__``, put ``str_maximal = true``
into the configuration (see below).


Retrieval
---------

You can call the feature system with an iterable of features to retrieve one of
its feature sets:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs(['+1', '+sg'])
    FeatureSet('+1 +sg')

Usually, it is more convenient to let the system extract the features from a
string:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('+1 +sg')
    FeatureSet('+1 +sg')

Leading plusses can be omitted. Spaces are optional. Case, order, and
duplication of features are ignored.

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('2 pl')
    FeatureSet('+2 +pl')

    >>> fs('SG3sg')
    FeatureSet('+3 +sg')

Note that commas are not allowed inside the string.


Uniqueness
----------

Feature sets are *singletons*. The constructor is also *idempotent*:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('1sg') is fs('1sg')
    True

    >>> fs(fs('1sg')) is fs('1sg')
    True

All different possible ways to notate a feature set map to the *same* instance:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('+1 -2 -3 -sg +pl') is fs('1pl')
    True

    >>> fs('+sg') is fs('-pl')
    True

Notations are equivalent, when they refer to the **same set of objects** (have
the same *extent*).


Comparisons
-----------

Compatibility tests:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('+1').incompatible_with(fs('+3'))
    True

    >>> fs('sg').complement_of(fs('pl'))
    True

    >>> fs('-1').subcontrary_with(fs('-2'))
    True

    >>> fs('+1').orthogonal_to(fs('+sg'))
    True

Set inclusion (*subsumption*):

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('') < fs('-3') <= fs('-3') < fs('+1') < fs('1sg')
    True


Operations
----------

Intersection (*join*, generalization, closest feature set that subsumes the
given ones):

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('1sg') % fs('2sg')  # common features, or?
    FeatureSet('-3 +sg')

Intersect an iterable of feature sets:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs.join([fs('+1'), fs('+2'), fs('1sg')])
    FeatureSet('-3')

Union (*meet*, unification, closest feature set that implies the given ones):

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('-1') ^ fs('-2')  # commbined features, and?
    FeatureSet('+3')

Unify an iterable of feature sets:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs.meet([fs('+1'), fs('+sg'), fs('-3')])
    FeatureSet('+1 +sg')

Relations
---------

Immediately implied/subsumed neighbors.

.. code:: python

    >>> fs('+1').upper_neighbors
    [FeatureSet('-3'), FeatureSet('-2')]

    >>> fs('+1').lower_neighbors
    [FeatureSet('+1 +sg'), FeatureSet('+1 +pl')]

Complete set of implied/subsumed neighbors.

.. code:: python

    >>> list(fs('+1').upset())
    [FeatureSet('+1'), FeatureSet('-3'), FeatureSet('-2'), FeatureSet('')]

    >>> list(fs('+1').downset())  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [FeatureSet('+1'),
     FeatureSet('+1 +sg'), FeatureSet('+1 +pl'),
     FeatureSet('+1 -1 +2 -2 +3 -3 +sg +pl -sg -pl')]


Visualization
-------------

Create a graph of the feature system lattice.

.. code:: python

    >>> dot = fs.graphviz()

    >>> print(dot.source)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    // <FeatureSystem('plural') of 6 atoms 22 featuresets>
    digraph plural {
    	graph [margin=0]
    	edge [arrowtail=none dir=back penwidth=.5]
    		f0 [label="+1 &minus;1 +2 &minus;2 +3 &minus;3 +sg +pl &minus;sg &minus;pl"]
    		f1 [label="+1 +sg"]
    			f1 -> f0
    		f2 [label="+1 +pl"]
    			f2 -> f0
    ...

Definition
----------

If you do not need to save your definition, you can directly create a system
from an ASCII-art style table:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs = features.make_features('''
    ...      |+male|-male|+adult|-adult|
    ... man  |  X  |     |   X  |      |
    ... woman|     |  X  |   X  |      |
    ... boy  |  X  |     |      |   X  |
    ... girl |     |  X  |      |   X  |
    ... ''', str_maximal=False)

    >>> fs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <FeatureSystem object of 4 atoms 10 featuresets at 0x...>

    >>> for f in fs:
    ...     print('%s %s' % (f, f.concept.extent))
    [+male -male +adult -adult] ()
    [+male +adult] ('man',)
    [-male +adult] ('woman',)
    [+male -adult] ('boy',)
    [-male -adult] ('girl',)
    [+adult] ('man', 'woman')
    [+male] ('man', 'boy')
    [-male] ('woman', 'girl')
    [-adult] ('boy', 'girl')
    [] ('man', 'woman', 'boy', 'girl')

Note that the strings representing the objects and features need to be disjoint
and features cannot be in substring relation.

To load feature systems by name, create an INI-file with your configurations,
for example:

.. code:: ini

    # phonemes.ini - define distinctive features

    [vowels]
    description = Distinctive vowel place features
    str_maximal = true
    context = 
       |+high|-high|+low|-low|+back|-back|+round|-round|
      i|  X  |     |    |  X |     |  X  |      |   X  |
      y|  X  |     |    |  X |     |  X  |   X  |      |
      ɨ|  X  |     |    |  X |  X  |     |      |   X  |
      u|  X  |     |    |  X |  X  |     |   X  |      |
      e|     |  X  |    |  X |     |  X  |      |   X  |
      ø|     |  X  |    |  X |     |  X  |   X  |      |
      ʌ|     |  X  |    |  X |  X  |     |      |   X  |
      o|     |  X  |    |  X |  X  |     |   X  |      |
      æ|     |  X  |  X |    |     |  X  |      |   X  |
      œ|     |  X  |  X |    |     |  X  |   X  |      |
      ɑ|     |  X  |  X |    |  X  |     |      |   X  |
      ɒ|     |  X  |  X |    |  X  |     |   X  |      |

Add your config file, overriding existing sections with the same name:

.. code:: python

    >>> features.add_config('docs/phonemes.ini')

If the filename is relative, it is resolved relative to the file where the
``add`` method was called. Check the documentation of the fileconfig_ package
for details.

Load your feature system:

.. code:: python

    >>> fs = features.FeatureSystem('vowels')

    >>> fs
    <FeatureSystem('vowels') of 12 atoms 55 featuresets>

Retrieve feature sets, extents and intents:

.. code:: python

    >>> print(fs('+high'))
    [+high -low]

    >>> print('high round = %s, %s' % fs('high round').concept.extent)
    high round = y, u

    >>> print('i, e, o = %s' % fs.lattice[('i', 'e', 'o')].intent)
    i, e, o = -low


Logical relations between feature pairs (excluding orthogonal pairs):

.. code:: python

    >>> print(fs.context.relations())  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    +high  complement   -high
    +low   complement   -low
    +back  complement   -back
    +round complement   -round
    +high  incompatible +low
    +high  implication  -low
    +low   implication  -high
    -high  subcontrary  -low


Usage example
-------------

Make a paradigm for the present and past tense forms of the English copula
*to be* and compute the common features for all different word forms.

Define a feature system with the **meanings** for the paradigm cells.

.. code:: python

    >>> context = '''
    ...         |+1|-1|+2|-2|+3|-3|+sg|+pl|+pst|-pst|
    ... 1sg.pres| X|  |  | X|  | X|  X|   |    |   X|
    ... 1pl.pres| X|  |  | X|  | X|   |  X|    |   X|
    ... 2sg.pres|  | X| X|  |  | X|  X|   |    |   X|
    ... 2pl.pres|  | X| X|  |  | X|   |  X|    |   X|
    ... 3sg.pres|  | X|  | X| X|  |  X|   |    |   X|
    ... 3pl.pres|  | X|  | X| X|  |   |  X|    |   X|
    ... 1sg.past| X|  |  | X|  | X|  X|   |   X|    |
    ... 1pl.past| X|  |  | X|  | X|   |  X|   X|    |
    ... 2sg.past|  | X| X|  |  | X|  X|   |   X|    |
    ... 2pl.past|  | X| X|  |  | X|   |  X|   X|    |
    ... 3sg.past|  | X|  | X| X|  |  X|   |   X|    |
    ... 3pl.past|  | X|  | X| X|  |   |  X|   X|    |'''

    >>> fs = features.make_features(context)

    >>> cellmeanings = fs.atoms

Enter the word **forms** for each cell.

.. code:: python

    >>> cellforms = [
    ...     'am', 'are',
    ...     'are', 'are',
    ...     'is', 'are',
    ... 
    ...     'was', 'were',
    ...     'were', 'were',
    ...     'was', 'were']

Create the **paradigm** as ordered mapping from meaning to form.

.. code:: python

    >>> from collections import OrderedDict

    >>> paradigm = OrderedDict(zip(cellmeanings, cellforms))

Pretty-print the meaning -> word form mapping.

.. code:: python

    >>> for meaning, form in paradigm.items():
    ...     print('%s | %s' % (meaning.string_extent, form))
    1sg.pres | am
    1pl.pres | are
    2sg.pres | are
    2pl.pres | are
    3sg.pres | is
    3pl.pres | are
    1sg.past | was
    1pl.past | were
    2sg.past | were
    2pl.past | were
    3sg.past | was
    3pl.past | were

Create a **correspondence** from each word form to the list of cell meanings
where it occurs.

.. code:: python

    >>> occurrences = OrderedDict()

    >>> for meaning in paradigm:
    ...     form = paradigm[meaning]
    ...     occurrences.setdefault(form, []).append(meaning)

Pretty-print the form -> occurrences mapping.

.. code:: python

    >>> for form in occurrences:
    ...     meanings = occurrences[form]
    ...     labels = ', '.join(m.string_extent for m in meanings)
    ...     print('%4s | %s' % (form, labels))
      am | 1sg.pres
     are | 1pl.pres, 2sg.pres, 2pl.pres, 3pl.pres
      is | 3sg.pres
     was | 1sg.past, 3sg.past
    were | 1pl.past, 2sg.past, 2pl.past, 3pl.past

Show the **common features** for all word forms. Computed with the
``join``-method (generalization, `least upper bound`_).

.. code:: python

    >>> for form in occurrences:
    ...     meanings = occurrences[form]
    ...     common = fs.join(meanings)
    ...     print('%4s | %s' % (form, common))
      am | [+1 +sg -pst]
     are | [-pst]
      is | [+3 +sg -pst]
     was | [-2 +sg +pst]
    were | [+pst]

Their **necessary conditions**.


Advanced usage
--------------

To customize the behavior of the feature sets, override the ``FeatureSet``
attribute of ``FeatureSystem`` with your subclass:

.. code:: python

    >>> class MyFeatures(features.FeatureSystem.FeatureSet):
    ...     @property
    ...     def features(self):
    ...         return list(self.concept.intent)

    >>> class MyFeatureSystem(features.FeatureSystem):
    ...     FeatureSet = MyFeatures

    >>> myfs = MyFeatureSystem('small')

    >>> myfs('1 -pl')
    MyFeatures('+1 -pl')

    >>> myfs('1 -pl').features
    ['+1', '-2', '-pl']
