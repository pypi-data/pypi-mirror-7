Description: imagemounter
        ============
        
        imagemounter is a command-line utility and Python package to ease the mounting and unmounting of EnCase, Affuse and dd
        disk images. It supports mounting disk images using xmount (with optional RW cache), affuse and ewfmount;
        detecting DOS, BSD, Sun, Mac and GPT volume systems; mounting Ext, UFS, LUKS and NTFS volumes; detecting (nested) LVM
        volume systems and mounting its subvolumes; and reconstructing RAID arrays.
        
        In its default mode, imagemounter will try to start mounting the base image on a temporary mount point,
        detect the volume system and then mount each volume seperately. If it fails finding a volume system,
        it will try to mount the entire image as a whole if it succeeds in detecting what it actually is.
        
        This package supports Python 2.6 and 2.7, and Python 3.2+. Versions before 1.5.0 depended on pytsk3, but 1.5.0
        introduced the option to use the result of the `mmls` command instead.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Just perform the following commands for a full install, including all optional dependencies (but see the note about
        Ubuntu 13.10 below):
        
            apt-get install python-setuptools xmount ewf-tools afflib-tools sleuthkit lvm2 mdadm cryptsetup
            pip install imagemounter
        
        ### Python packages
        This package does not require other packages, though _termcolor_ is recommended.
        
        If you wish to use _pytsk3_ support, you require `python-dev` and `libtsk-dev`. For compilation, the `build-essential`
        package from your distribution is also required. After that, you can easily install the `pytsk3` package from PyPI
        (pip requires the --pre flag to allow installing the package).
        
        ### Other dependencies
        This package highly depends on other utilities to be present on your system. For a full installation, you require the
        following tools:
        
        - Mount tools
          - `xmount`
          - `ewfmount`, part of ewf-tools package, see note below
          - `affuse`, part of afflib-tools package
        - Volume detection
          - `mmls`, part of sleuthkit package
          - `pytsk3`
        - Statistics, e.g. last mountpoint of volumes
          - `fsstat`, part of sleuthkit package
        - LVM volumes
          - `lvm` et al, all part of lvm2 package
        - RAID arrays
          - `mdadm`
        - LUKS volumes
          - `cryptsetup`
        
        A basic installation contains at least one of the mount tools. Highly recommended is also `fsstat`, others are required
        for specific file system types.
        
        #### ewfmount on Ubuntu 13.10
        Due to a bug with ewf-tools in Ubuntu <=13.10, it may be that ewfmount is not properly provided. This bug has been
        resolved in Ubuntu 14.04. If you are using Ubuntu 13.10, you can install ewf-tools with ewfmount as follows:
        
        1. Download a recent build of ewf-tools from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libewf/20130416-2ubuntu1 (choose your
        arch under 'Builds' and download all deb files under 'Built files')
        2. Execute `sudo apt-get install libbfio1`
        3. Execute `sudo dpkg -i ewf-tools_* libewf2_*`
        
        
        Commands and execution order
        ----------------------------
        imagemounter utilizes many command line utilities to perform its actions. It does not actually do a lot by itself,
        although it manages currently mounted sytems and provides the correct unmounting order. To gather a general idea of
        what the tool does, the following is a non-exhaustive list of the commands used in what order in the default mode.
        
        - `xmount`, `affuse` or `ewfmount` to mount the image
        - `mdadm` to detect whether this image is part of a RAID array, and if so:
          - `losetup` to mount the image to a loopback device
          - `mdadm` to add the image to the RAID array
        - Python equivalent of `mmls` to detect volumes (if none found, the image is mounted as one volume)
        - `fsstat` to gather additional information about the volume
        - `mount` to actually mount the volumes, or, in the case of a LVM:
          - `losetup` to mount the volume to a loopback device
          - `lvm pvscan` to scan for LVM systems
          - `vgchange` to activate the LVM system
          - `lvdisplay` to detect volumes (and again perform `fsstat` and `mount`, etc)
        
          or in the case of a LUKS volume:
          - `losetup` to mount the volume to a loopback device
          - `cryptsetup luksOpen` to open the volume
        
        The same is performed in reverse (ish) order to unmount the image.
        
        Important notes
        ---------------
        Not all combinations of file and volume systems have been tested. If you encounter an issue, please try to change some
        of your arguments first, before creating a new GitHub issue.
        
        Please note that many Linux based operating systems will try to mount LVMs for you. Although imagemounter tries to
        circumvent this automation, if you are unable to properly unmount, you should try to unmount through the interface of
        your OS first. Another useful command is `vgchange -a n` to disable all LVMs currently active (only use if you are not
        using a LVM for your own OS!).
        
        With `imount --clear` you can clear MOST temporary files and mounts, though this will not clean everything. If you used
        `--pretty` this tool can't do anything for you. It is therefore recommended to first try and mount your image without
        `--pretty`, to allow you to easily clean up if something crashes.
        
        CLI usage
        ---------
        In its most basic form, the installed command line utility (`imount`) accepts a positional argument pointing to
        the disk image, e.g.:
        
            imount disk.E01
            
        You can pass multiple disks to the same command. This allows the command to mount across multiple disks,
        which is useful when you wish to reconstruct volumes split across multiple disks, or for reconstructing a RAID array.
        
        imount will by default mount each volume in /tmp/ and ask you whether you want to keep it mounted, or want to unmount
        this. After the entire image has been processed, all volumes must be unmounted. You can change the default mount point
        with `--mountdir`. You can prettify the automatically generated name with `--pretty`.
        
        You can use `--keep` to not unmount the volume after the program stops. However, you are recommended to not use this in
        combination with `--mountdir` or `--pretty`, as `--clean` can not detect volumes with non-default naming.
        
        If you wish to reconstruct an image with UFS/Ext volumes with known former mountpoints, you can reconstruct the image
        with its former mountpoints using `--reconstruct`. For instance, if you have partitions previously mounted at /, /var
        and /home, /var and /home will be bind-mounted in /, providing you with a single filesystem tree.
        
        By default, information about volumes is provided by `fsstat`. This may, however,
        sometimes cause issues. You can disable this additional information gathering with `--no-stats`.
        
        You can disable the RAID check with `--no-raid`. If you know your volumes are not single volumes, or you know they are,
        use `--no-single` and `--single` respectively.
        
        Some volumes may not be automatically detected. If you know the type, you could use --fstypes to specify for each volume
        index the specific type, e.g. --fstypes=6=luks,6.0=lvm,6.0.0=ext. With --fsfallback you can specify a fallback if no
        type was detected, e.g. --fstypes=ext (use unknown to just mount and see what happens). --fsforce can be used to
        override automatic detection (--fstypes is not overriden).
        
        Use `imount --help` to discover more options.
        
        Python package
        --------------
        The Python package consists of three main parts:
        
        - The ImageParser, maintaining a list of Disks, providing several methods that are carried out on all disks (e.g.
          mount) and reconstruct.
        - The Disk, which represents a single disk iamge and can be mounted, added to RAID,
          and detect and maintain volumes. It is also responsible for maintaining the write cache.
        - The Volume, which can detect its own type and fill its stats, can be mounted, and detect LVM (sub)volumes.
        
        All three classes maintain an init() method that yields the volumes below it. You should call clean on the parser if
        you are done; you may also unmount separate volumes or disks, which will also unmount all volumes below it. Warning:
        unmounting one of the RAID volumes in a RAID array, causes the entire array to be unmounted.
        
        The constructor of ImageParser allows most of the command-line arguments to be passed (note that e.g. --no-raid is
        passed as raid=False, and that arguments such as --color are not known), with the notable exception of --single and
        --no-single, which distinguishes between disk.mount_* methods.
        
        Basic usage:
        
            >>> import imagemounter
            >>> parser = imagemounter.ImageParser(["disk.E01"])  # similar arguments as imount are possible
            >>> for volume in parser.init():
            ...     print volume.label, bool(volume.mountpoint)
            ...     volume.unmount()
            ...
            None False
            None False
            None False
            / True
            /var True
            >>> parser.clean()
            True
        
        `imount` utilizes the same API, so you should be able to figure it out yourself.
