Instructions For How ZShell User Should Use These Completion Scripts
====================================================================

What you need:

- A place to store the scripts in. This is already taken care of if
  you are using juicer from a package.

- Auto completion enabled in ZSH.

- The location of the scripts is in your ZSH 'fpath'.


Script Locations
----------------

If you are using Juicer from a package then the scripts should already
be present on your system. Generally speaking they will be in
/usr/share/juicer/completions/zsh/.

If you are using Juicer from a source checkout you will need to make a
place for them yourself, using ~/.zsh-completions is good.


Enable Autocomplete in ZSH
---------------------------

Ensure the following lines are present in your ~/.zshrc file:

    autoload -U compinit
    compinit

For extra style, add these lines too

    zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=2 
    zstyle ':completion:' verbose yes
    zstyle ':completion:' :descriptions format %B%d%b
    zstyle ':completion:' :messages format %d
    zstyle ':completion:' :warnings format No matches for: %d
    zstyle ':completion:' group-name 
    zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format "%B%d%b"


Update the ZSH 'fpath' variable
-------------------------------

Add the following* to your ~/.zshrc

    fpath=(~/.zsh-completions $fpath)

* Substitute ~/.zsh-completions with whatever path the scripts are
actually in. RPM packages will install them into:

    /usr/share/juicer/completions/zsh/
