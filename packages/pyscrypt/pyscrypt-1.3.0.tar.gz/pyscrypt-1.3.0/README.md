pyscrypt
========

A very simple, pure-Python implementation of the scrypt password-based key derivation function and scrypt file format libraries with no dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.



API

### scrypt PBKDF hash

The scrypt algorithm is a password-based key derivation function, which takes in several parameters to adjust the difficulty and returns a string of bytes. This is useful for transforming passwords into a target length, while at the same time increaing the cost of attempting to brute-froce guess a password.

* `password` - a passowrd
* `salt` - a cryptographic salt
* `N` - general work factor
* `r` - memory cost
* `p` - computation cost (parallelization factor)
* `dkLen` - the output length (in bytes) to return


```python
import pyscrypt

hashed = pyscrypt.hash(password = "correct horse battery staple", 
                       salt = "seasalt", 
                       N = 1024, 
                       r = 1, 
                       p = 1, 
                       dkLen = 256)
print hashed.encode('hex')
```

### Write a scrypt Encrypted File

When writing a file the `N`, `r` and `p` parameters are required. The `salt` parameter is optional, and if omitted will be generated from _urandom_.

The scrypt file format includes a final checksum in the file, so be sure to close the file to ensure the checksum is correctly flushed to disk. If the underlying file object cannot be closed (for example, StringIO will release its contents on close) then use the `finalize` method.

```python
import pyscrypt

fp = file('filename.scrypt', 'w')
f = pyscrypt.ScryptFile(fp, "password", N = 1024, r = 1, p = 1)
f.write("Hello World")
f.close()

# Instead of close, use this method to keep the underlying file open
#f.finalize()
```

### Read a scrypt Encrypted File

```python
import pyscrypt

# Read the entire contents
fp = file('filename.scrypt')
f = pyscrypt.ScryptFile(fp, password = "password")
print f.read()

# Iterate over each line
fp = file('filename.scrypt')
f = pyscrypt.ScryptFile(fp, password = "password")
for line in f:
  print line

# Ensure the integrity of the file after completely read
print f.valid
```



Test Harness
------------

A handful of test cases are provided for both the hash algorithm and the ScryptFile library. The ScryptFile tests generate tests that can be validated against the command line utility (http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).

FAQ

**Why is this so slow?**
It is written in pure Python. It is not meant to be fast, more of a reference solution.

On my MacBook Air, I get around 3,000 hashes/s using a C-wrapper while I get around 2 hashes/s using this implementation.

**How do I get one of these C wrappers you speak of?**

```python

> curl -L https://github.com/forrestv/p2pool/archive/13.4.tar.gz > p2pool-13.4.tar.gz

> # Untar
> tar -xzf p2pool-13.4.tar.gz

> # Build and install
> cd p2pool-13.4/litecoin_scrypt/
> python setup.py build
> sudo python setup.py install

> python
>>> import scrypt
>>> scrypt.hash(password = "correct horse staple battery", 
                salt = "seasalt", 
                N = 1024, 
                p = 1, 
                r = 1, 
                buflen = 256)
```
