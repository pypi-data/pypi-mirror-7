Description: ===============
        MxDateTimeField
        ===============
        
        Note: This module is meant to be used in migrated sites and not for
        modern plone 4.x use.
        
        This field enables Archetypes to use mxDateTime fields. It is very simple,
        it just transforms (well formed) strings into mxDateTime values. You can use
        the Field in Archetypes schemas like this::
        
            ...
        
            from Products.MxDateTimeField import MxDateTimeField
            ...
        
            schema= Schema((
                MxDateTimeField('BirthDate'),
        
            ...
        
        The benefit of the MxDateTimeField is that a wider range of time designations
        is supported, dates may range from 5'000'000CE to 5'000'000BCE. Sometimes
        you encounter Problems in Plone when you want to use such dates.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You need to install egenix mxDateTime first, it is part of 'mxBase', see
        http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#Download-mxBASE
        
        Several Operating Systems are offering the egenix mxDateTime within their
        package management systems.
        
        Then just put the MxDateTime folder into your Zopes 'Products' directory.
        The Product should be listed among your Zopes Products in the control panel.
