Overview
========

Pysheet is your best companion for data management. It can read and write to a delimited text file (spreadsheet), consolidate columns and merge spreadsheets together. It allows you to query for information thus turning your text file into a lightweight database. It can be used both as a python library (from pysheet import Pysheet) and as a command-line tool (pysheet -h) and supports concurrent access control for reading/writing to the same file in parallel.

Quick Start
-----------

   ::

       pip install pysheet

       pysheet --write 1 A world 2 B hello 3 C ! -k 2 1 3 -v

Output:

   ::

      ID |   B   |   A   | C
      ===+=======+=======+==
      1  |       | world |
      2  | hello |       |
      3  |       |       | !
