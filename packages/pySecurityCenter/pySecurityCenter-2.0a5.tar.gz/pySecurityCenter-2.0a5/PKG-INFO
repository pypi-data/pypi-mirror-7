Description: Python Security Center Module
        =============================
        
        This module is designed to attempt to make interfacing with Security
        Center's API easier to use and more manageable. A lot of effort has been
        put into making queries into the API as painless and manageable as
        possible.

        How to Install
        ==============
        
        To install pySecurityCenter, you can use either pip or easy\_install to
        install from the cheeseshop:
        
        ``pip install pysecuritycenter``
        
        ``easy_install pysecuritycenter``
        
        If you would rather install manually, feel free to download the latest
        version directly from the
        `cheeseshop <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySecurityCenter>`__:
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        **Note**: All examples are currently using the Base module, not the ORM.
        The document will be updated eventually to explain how to use both
        methods at a later date.
        
        The new interface is designed to be a lot easier to use than the
        previous one. While currently there are fewer functions to present the
        data back to you, what has been coded so far has been expressly designed
        with usability in mind. Below is a basic example showing the result of
        the sumip tool:
        
        ::
        
            >>> import securitycenter
            >>> sc = securitycenter.SecurityCenter('ADDRESS','USER','PASS')
            >>> ips = sc.query('sumip', repositoryIDs='1')
            >>> len(ips)
            240
            >>> ips[0]
            {u'macAddress': '', u'severityHigh': u'0', u'severityMedium': u'3', 
            u'ip': u'10.10.0.1', u'netbiosName': '', u'repositoryID': u'1', 
            u'severityCritical': u'0', u'score': u'47', u'severityLow': u'38', 
            u'total': u'41', u'dnsName': u'pfsense.home.lan', u'severityInfo': u'0'}
        
        By default, the query function will perform as many queries to the API
        as needed to pull all of the data and return all of the information as a
        single list. There are cases however where the dataset that is returned
        back may be too large to load everything into memory. In this case there
        is the option to pass a function to the API to handle the data for you.
        In this case, the API will not populate the list that will be returned
        back. Below is an example of how this works:
        
        ::
        
            >>> import securitycenter
            >>> def count(data):
            ...     print len(data)
            ... 
            >>> sc = securitycenter.SecurityCenter('ADDRESS','USER','PASS')
            >>> sc.query('sumip', func=count, repositoryIDs='1')
            240
            []
        
        One of the nice things about the query function is that we can also use
        it to parse LCE event data as well. For example:
        
        ::
        
            >>> import securitycenter
            >>> sc = securitycenter.SecurityCenter('ADDRESS','USER','PASS')
            >>> events = sc.query('sumip', source='lce')
            >>> len(events)
            425
        
        For other functions, please use the raw\_query function until the
        functions have been rewritten. For detailed documentation for the
        various other things that can be done, please reference the Security
        Center API documentation.
        
        SSL Support
        -----------
        
        If Python is compiled with SSL support, SecurityCenter can support
        two-way SSL.
        
                    sc = SecurityCenter("ADDRESS", "USER", "PASS", ...
                    key="KEY\_FILE\_PATH", cert="CERT\_FILE\_PATH")
        
        Available Functions
        ===================
        
        raw\_query
        ----------
        
        **Required Inputs:** module, action
        
        **Optional Inputs:** data, headers, dejson
        
        Info
        ~~~~
        
        The raw\_query function is the most basic function exposed for general
        use. This function is simply a thin wrapper around the private *request
        function and will strip out information higher on the return tree than
        the response. If an error code is thrown, then it will throw an APIError
        exception with the error code and the error message. All other public
        functions route calls through raw*\ query.
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            sc.raw_query(module, action, data={}, headers={}, dejson=True)
        
        Options
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  **module:** [string] The API module to be called. For information on
           the available modules that can be called, please reference the API
           documentation from Tenable.
        
        -  **action:** [string] The API module's action to be called. For
           information on the available actions that a module may have, please
           reference the API documentation from Tenable.
        
        -  **data:** [dictionary] The data dictionary that is placed into the
           'input' definition of the JSON POST request to the API. This is
           highly dependent on the module and action being called and
           information about what should be contained in here is in the API
           documentation from Tenable.
        
        -  **headers:** [dictionary] The HTTP headers that will be sent as part
           of the POST request to the API. While publicly exposed, there is
           almost never a need to add anything into this dictionary.
        
        -  **dejson:** [boolean] Tells the \_request function weather or not we
           want to convert the HTTP response into a python dictionary. As most
           responses will be JSON formatted strings, this is normally left
           alone, however there are cases where turning this off is needed. For
           example when downloading scan results.
        
        query
        -----
        
        **Required Inputs:** tool
        
        **Optional Inputs:** filters, source, sort, direction, func,
        func\_params, req\_size, scan, directory, filterset
        
        Info
        ~~~~
        
        The query function is designed to make querying vulnerability and event
        data within Security Center as painless as possible. By handling the
        vast majority of the boilerplate code within this function, it is
        possible to write one line queries into the API. This function also
        merges together querying both vulnerability and event data as most of
        the methodology for querying either dataset is the same.
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            sc.query(tool, filters=None, source='cumulative', sort=None, direction=None,
            func=None, func_params=None, req_size=1000, scan=None, directory=None,
            **filterset)
        
        Options
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  **tool** [string] The query tool to be run on the API. This can be
           any of the query tools from vuln::query or event::query depending on
           the data source you are using. These tools are the same as when
           running a search query in the main WebUI. Refer to the API
           documentation for a list of available tools.
        
        -  **filters** [list] If a complex filter is needed (something more than
           x=y) then you will need to populate this list as well. As per the
           documentation, the filters list is a list of dictionary items
           detailing the filterName, operator, and value of the filter. Each
           dictionary item should look like the example below:
           ``{'filterName': 'exploitAvailable', 'operator': '=', 'value': 'true'}``\ 
           Generally speaking this option is available if needed, however should
           almost never be used. Instead use the less error-prone and more
           efficient \*\*filterset dictionary
        
        -  **source** [string] Defines the data source to be used for the query.
           There are three options available to query from. Please keep in mind
           that this variable invariably determines if you will be querying
           event or vulnerability data and the toolset & filterset will be
           different depending on which data source you query.
        
           -  *cumulative:* Cumulative vulnerability data
           -  *mitigated:* Mitigated vulnerability data
        
        -  *individual*: Individual scan data
        
           -  *lce:* LCE event data
        
        -  **sort** [string] Specifies the field name to sort by. Default is
           None.
        
        -  **direction** [string] If a sort field is specified, then this option
           will specify the sort direction desired. The default is descending
           (desc) however ascending (asc) can be selected as well.
        
        -  **func** [function] If func is defined, it will allow for an
           alternate way to handle the data that is being queried. Instead of
           flattening the dataset into a single list, which can be problematic
           for very large datasets, the query function will instead send the
           vuln data directly to a function passed on to it and will not
           populate any data into the list to be returned. This means that it is
           possible to handle very large datasets in smaller chunks if desired.
           For an example of how this is used, refer to the CSV\_GEN example
           script. The generator module shows exactly how this would be handled.
        
        -  **func\_params** [dictionary] An optional dictionary parameter list
           to be sent to the function defined in the func option. This is useful
           if more information than just the query data needs to be sent to the
           function for processing.
        
        -  **req\_size** [integer] How many items to query from the API at a
           time. The default is 1000. Keep in mind that larger values may not
           increase the speed of the API and may actually slow down other
           operations on the Security Center host. Adjust at your own risk.
        
        -  **scan** [integer] When the source is ``"individual"``, this must be
           the id of the scan to query.
        
        -  **directory** [string or datetime] When the source is
           ``"individual"``, this must be the date directory for the given scan
           id. The format should be ``"YYYY-mm-dd"``, or a datetime which will
           be converted to this. It is unclear why this is needed, but it seems
           to be the finish time of the scan.
        
        -  \_\_\*\*filterset\_\_ [dictionary][parameters] Filterset is the
           catchall for the various filters that can be called for the query.
           Any filters that you would want to run should be after all other
           options in the query to insure that they are all lumped into this
           filterset dictionary. as this dictionary is parameterized, there is
           no need to specify the options like in a normal dictionary, instead
           simply declare them as if specifying any other option in the
           function. for example:
           ``sc.query('vulndetails', exploitAvailable='true', severity='2,3,4')``\ 
           This query will set the expploitAvailable filter to true and the
           severity to '2,3,4' (Medium, High, and Critical). As you can see,
           defining filters this way is a lot cleaner than specifying them in
           the raw format as with the **filters** dictionary.

        Updates an asset list with the optional inputs provided. This function
        will first perform an asset list lookup and populate the request to be
        sent with the current values, then override those values with what was
        requested in the optional parameters. This means it is possible to only
        update the ip list, or description, without having to pull and populate
        everything else by hand.
