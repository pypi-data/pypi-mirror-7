Description: PlotDevice is a Macintosh application used for computational graphic design. It provides an
        interactive Python environment where you can create two-dimensional graphics
        and output them in a variety of vector, bitmap, and animation formats. It is
        meant both as a sketch environment for exploring generative design and as a
        general purpose graphics library for use in stand-alone Python programs.
        
        PlotDevice is a fork of NodeBox 1.9.7rc1 with support for modern versions of
        Python and Mac OS.
        
        The new version features:
        
        * Enhanced command line interface.
        * New text editor with tab completion, syntax color themes, and emacs/vi bindings.
        * Video export in H.264 or animated gif formats (with GCD-based i/o).
        * Added support for external editors by reloading the source when changed.
        * Build system now works with Xcode or ``py2app`` for the application and ``pip`` for the module.
        * Virtualenv support (for both installation of the module and running scripts with dependencies).
        * External scripts can use ``from plotdevice import *`` to create a drawing environment.
        * Simplified bezier & affine transform api using the python ‘with’ statement
        * New compositing operations for blend mode, global opacity, and dropshadows
        * Simplified typography commands with stylesheet-based character styles
        * Now uses the system's Python 2.7 interpreter.
        
        Requires:
        
        * Mac OS X 10.9+
