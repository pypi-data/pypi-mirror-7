MediaWiki events
================
Wiki-tool builders & researchers rely on various sources of information about what's happened and is currently happening in Wikipedia. These data sources tend to be structured in differently and contain incomplete or poorly structured information.  Some datasources are queryable, but require complexity to "listen" to ongoing events while others are intended to only be used to "listen" to current events. ''MediaWiki events'' is designed to minimize the frustration involved in process MediaWiki's events.
