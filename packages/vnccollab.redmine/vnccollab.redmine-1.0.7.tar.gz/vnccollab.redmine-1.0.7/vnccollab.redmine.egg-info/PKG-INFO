        ================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        ``vnccollab.redmine`` offers plone-redmine integration in the form of
        one portlet to access to redmine tickets and a viewlet to view the
        associated tickets to the current content.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Please read INSTALL.rst for details about the installation.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installing the package, the User's Personal Information page
        is extended with two fields: ``Redmine Username`` and ``Redmine Password``.
        These fields are needed to authenticate against the redmine server.
        
        For the viewlet to work, the admin must configure the registry
        entry ``vnccollab.redmine.server_url`` with the URL of the redmine server.
        
        ``vnccollab.redmine`` offers a portlet ``Redmine: Tickets`` that shows
        the tickets the current user can see. This portlet can be added in the
        usual way.
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        Due to the use of plone.app.jquery 1.7.2, there could be some issues with
        overlays in Plone 4.2.
