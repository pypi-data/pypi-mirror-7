Noteworthy changes in 0.5.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the majority of changes in this release were contributed back
from the Debian pyzor package.

	*	Man pages for pyzor and pyzord.

	*	Changing back to signals for database locking,
		rather than threads.  It is likely that signals
		will be removed again in the future, but the
		existing threading changes caused problems.

	*	Basic checks on the results of "discover".

	*	Extended mbox support throughout the library.

	*	Better handling on unknown encodings.

	*	Added a --log option to log to a file.

	*	Better handling of command-line options.

	*	Improved error handling.

Noteworthy changes in 0.4.x
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	pyzor client now more gracefully handles base64 and
	multipart decoding errors, so that it can be used
	over an mbox.

    *	pyzor client has new config file option in the [client]
	section, Timeout, which specifies a timeout in seconds
	for queries to come back to the client.

    *	pyzord no longer daemonizes itself, and now writes
	it logging to standard output.

    *	The following server config options no longer have effect:
	PidFile, LogFile.

    *	Upped the allowed signed timestamp difference to be up to
	5 minutes (up from 3 minutes).

    *	Removed the 'shutdown' command; implementation of
	'meta' commands need to be re-thought.

    *	Rewrite of threads locking to access the database.

    *	pyzord no longer handles USR1 signals; instead, it now
	automatically reorganizes and cleans-up the database daily.

    *	Client code now uses threading to catch timeouts,
	rather than an alarm signal.


Noteworthy changes in 0.4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Messages are now decoded if they are encoded,
	and subparts that are not encoded text/* are ignored.
	Currently base64, quoted-printable, and uuencode
	is supported.

    *	Message normalization now removes HTML tags
	(irregardless of Content-Type).

    *	Message lines with less than 8 chars after normalization
	are now not included in digests.

    *	Messages having less than or equal to 4 lines are entirely
	digested.

    *	Implemented 'digest' command, which simply prints
	out the digest(s) of the messages encountered.

    *	Implemented 'predigest' command which prints out
	the data that is actually digested in a message.

    *	If HOME is unspecified and no --homedir is given,
	The the config directory is /etc/pyzor

    *	If the pyzord process receives a HUP signal, it re-opens
	the logfile.


Noteworthy changes in 0.3.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Fixed bug where if pyzor would send reports or
	whitelists to each server N times, where N
	is the number of servers.

    *	Server now keeps database file open, instead of re-opening
	it on each request.

    *	pyzord.log now includes response code.


Noteworthy changes in 0.3.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Pyzor now requires Python 2.2.1.

    *	The protocol is not backwards compatible, so please
	remove old ~/.pyzor/servers files, and they will
	be refreshened to point to new servers.

    *	The pyzor system now has accounts, access controls on
	users.  anonymous users by default can do
	['check', 'report', 'ping', 'info'].
	For more information on this, please refer to the
	documentation.

    *	Documentation has moved from the source files
	(e.g., 'pydoc pyzor') into a separate XHTML document,
	located in docs/usage.html, and normally installed
	into a location such as /usr/share/doc/pyzor

    *	Messages are authenticated using digest-signing, similar
	to HTTP-digest authentication.  This is a
	is a shared-secret scheme, but the secret is very
	hard to recover from what is passed in the signature.

    *	Whitelisting messages is now possible.

    *	An 'info' command is no implemented
	This returns extra info about any digest, such as
	when it was first entered and last updated.

    *	a 'genkey' command has been implemented for the client;
	this is used to create a (salt, key) string
	used for authentication.

    *	a 'shutdown' commmand has been implemented, which can
	be used to shutdown a server.

    *	Expiring of digests using a USR1 signal has been removed
	for now.  In the future a client/server message
	will be likely be implemented for this functionality.

    *	pyzrod logfile now contains a human-readable timestamp
	field in addition to the epoch-seconds field.



Noteworthy changes in 0.2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *   Fixed major bug where the incorrect exit
	code is given.


Noteworthy changes in 0.2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Protocol break.  Old clients will not work
	with new servers, and vice versa.

    *	~/.pyzor is now a directory, with ~/.pyzor/config
	containing configuration directives.
	~/.pyzor/servers contains a list of servers.

    *	pyzord's command-line interface has changed,
	now being primarily configured in ~/.pyzor/config.

    *	pyzord now does logging (~/.pyzor/pyzord.log) and has
	a pidfile (~/.pyzor/pyzord.pid).

    *	Debugging for client and server improved.

    *	Client now contacts each server listed
	when doing a check/report/ping.

    *	Can now be used with ReadyExec,
	http://readyexec.sourceforge.net/
	Documentation on how to use ReadyExec is
	in the pyzor documentation.


Noteworthy changes in 0.1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Fixed problem when trying to report messages
	in non-unix mailbox format.

    *	Added --mbox option for 'pyzor report' for when
	reporting entire mailboxes.

    *	No changes were made in the server portion.


Noteworthy changes in 0.1.0
