Pyzor requires at least Python 2.6

To install this distribution, simply run the following:
	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install

Note that your system might install the modules and scripts
with non-world-readable permissions.
Correct this with a command such as:

	chmod -R a+rX /usr/share/doc/pyzor \
		/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/pyzor \
		/usr/bin/pyzor /usr/bin/pyzord

To use the server, the Python gdbm module or MySQLdb module is required.
You can generally check if you have the gdbm module by executing:
	python -c 'import gdbm' && echo 'gdbm found'
You can generally check if you have the MySQLdb module by executing:
	python -c 'import MySQLdb' && echo 'MySQLdb found'

The gdbm module is available at:
	Debian GNU/Linux:
		http://packages.debian.org/stable/interpreters/python-gdbm.html
	Gentoo Linux:
		Will be built with Python if the gdbm library is found.
		If it isn't there with your Python, try stealing
		the FreeBSD setup.py patchfile in their ports to
		install just the gdbm module, or simply re-install
		Python.
	FreeBSD:
		ports/databases/py-gdbm
	tar.gz:
		included in the Python distribution
		(not sure of the precise procedure for simply installing
		the gdbm module; try stealing the FreeBSD setup.py patchfile
		in their ports).

Pyzor also works with Python3.3. The code will be automatically refactored with
2to3 during the setup:
	python3.3 setup.py install

Note that the MySQLdb library does not currently support Python3.

See docs/usage.html for usage documentation, and if you are upgrading
from another version of Pyzor, please read the UPGRADING file.
