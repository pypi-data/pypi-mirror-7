This is a Python (2 and 3) library to access the `Github API v3 <http://developer.github.com/v3>`_.
With it, you can manage `Github <http://github.com>`_ resources (repositories, user profiles, organizations, etc.) from Python scripts.

It covers almost the full API (see "What's missing" bellow), and all methods are tested against the real Github site.

Should you have any question, any remark, or if you find a bug, or if there is something you can do with the API but not with PyGithub, please `open an issue <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues>`_.

PyGithub 1.x.x is stable and I don't plan to spend time adding missing functionalities. I still accept you pull requests.
Here is the `references documentation <http://jacquev6.github.io/PyGithub/v1>`_.

I'm currently developing the `version 2 of PyGithub <https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/tree/develop_v2>`_.
Here is the `documentation <http://jacquev6.github.io/PyGithub/v2/index.html#migration-strategy-and-maintenance-schedule>`_, including a migration planning.
