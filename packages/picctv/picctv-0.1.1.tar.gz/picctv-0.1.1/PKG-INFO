        pi-cctv is a script for use with your raspberry pi and raspberry pi camera module.
        When ran it will continually take image captures with the camera module (placing them in an 'images' folder). Images which appear to be at night time will be disgarded to save on disk space.
        
        ### Pre-installation tips
        
          If you're using Wifi you'll want to make the raspberry pi reconnect
          when it drops:
        
            cd /etc/ifplugd/action.d/
            mv ifupdown ifupdown.original
            cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/ifupdown.sh ./ifupdown
            sudo reboot
        
        ### Installation
        
            pip install picctv
        
        ### Example Usage
        
            picctv -o /media/ext1/
