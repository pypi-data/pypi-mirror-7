Description: pypiece
        =======
        
        Wrapper around pip for use with flaky connections.
        
        Basic idea behind it is that default behaviour of `pip` to download all packages at once
        and compile them can get pretty frustrating in situations, where single error in 
        downloading or installing a package can result in repeating whole process all
        over again.
        
        `pypiece` tries to get around that by trying to download and install each package
        separately, by calling `pip` for each line of requirements.txt. In the end it
        outputs list of successfully installed packages and ones that failed.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
            pypiece < requirements file > < -- PIP options >
        
        Available options:
          
         - `--pip` - specify pip binary to use
         -  `--retries <N>` - try to reinstall failing package _N_ times (default: 3).
         -  `--venv <name>` - install to virtualenvwrapper created virtual environment _name_.
        
        pip arguments
        -------------
        If `--` is found in command line, then all arguments
        after it will be passed unchanged to `pip` executable on every call.
        
        For example: 
        
            pypiece requirements.txt -- -i https://my.pypi.repo
        
        Last line is equivalent to: 
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://my.pypi.repo
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Try to install every package found in _requirements.txt_ one by one:
        
            pypiece requirements.txt
        
        Install requirements using `pip` from virtualenv _test_:
        
            pypiece --venv test requirements.txt
        
        Install requirements using specified `pip` binary:
        
            pypiece --pip my_env/bin/pip requirements.txt
