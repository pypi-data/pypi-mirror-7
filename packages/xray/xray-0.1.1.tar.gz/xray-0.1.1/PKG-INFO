Description: 
        **xray** is a Python package for working with aligned sets of
        homogeneous, n-dimensional arrays. It implements flexible array
        operations and dataset manipulation for in-memory datasets within the
        `Common Data
        Model <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/CDM/>`__
        widely used for self-describing scientific data (e.g., the NetCDF file
        format).
        
        Why xray?
        ---------
        
        Adding dimensions names and coordinate values to numpy's
        `ndarray <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.ndarray.html>`__
        makes many powerful array operations possible:
        
        -  Apply operations over dimensions by name: ``x.sum('time')``.
        -  Select values by label instead of integer location:
           ``x.loc['2014-01-01']`` or ``x.labeled(time='2014-01-01')``.
        -  Mathematical operations (e.g., ``x - y``) vectorize across multiple
           dimensions (known in numpy as "broadcasting") based on dimension
           names, regardless of their original order.
        -  Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:
           ``x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()``.
        -  Database like aligment based on coordinate labels that smoothly
           handles missing values: ``x, y = xray.align(x, y, join='outer')``.
        -  Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:
           ``x.attrs``.
        
        **xray** aims to provide a data analysis toolkit as powerful as
        `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ but designed for working with
        homogeneous N-dimensional arrays instead of tabular data. Indeed, much
        of its design and internal functionality (in particular, fast indexing)
        is shamelessly borrowed from pandas.
        
        Because **xray** implements the same data model as the NetCDF file
        format, xray datasets have a natural and portable serialization format.
        But it's also easy to robustly convert an xray ``DataArray`` to and from
        a numpy ``ndarray`` or a pandas ``DataFrame`` or ``Series``, providing
        compatibility with the full `PyData ecosystem <http://pydata.org/>`__.
