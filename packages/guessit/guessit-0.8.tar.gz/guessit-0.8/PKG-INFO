        GuessIt is a python library that tries to extract as much information as
        possible from a video file.
        
        It has a very powerful filename matcher that allows to guess a lot of
        metadata from a video using only its filename. This matcher works with
        both movies and tv shows episodes.
        
        For example, GuessIt can do the following::
        
            $ guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
            For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
            GuessIt found: {
                [1.00] "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
                [0.80] "episodeNumber": 3,
                [0.80] "videoCodec": "XviD",
                [1.00] "container": "avi",
                [1.00] "format": "HDTV",
                [0.70] "series": "Treme",
                [0.50] "title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
                [0.80] "releaseGroup": "NoTV",
                [0.80] "season": 1,
                [1.00] "type": "episode"
            }
        
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        At the moment, the filename matcher is able to recognize the following
        property types::
        
            [ title,                             # for movies and episodes
              series, season,                    # for episodes only
              episodeNumber, episodeDetails,     # for episodes only
              date, year,                        # 'date' instance of datetime.date
              language, subtitleLanguage,        # instances of babelfish.Language
              country,                           # instances of babelfish.Country
              fileSize, duration,                # when detecting video file metadata
              container, format,
              videoCodec, audioCodec,
              videoProfile, audioProfile,
              audioChannels, screenSize,
              releaseGroup, website,
              cdNumber, cdNumberTotal,
              filmNumber, filmSeries,
              bonusNumber, edition,
              idNumber,                          # tries to identify a hash or a serial number
              other
              ]
        
        
        GuessIt also allows you to compute a whole lof of hashes from a file,
        namely all the ones you can find in the hashlib python module (md5,
        sha1, ...), but also the Media Player Classic hash that is used (amongst
        others) by OpenSubtitles and SMPlayer, as well as the ed2k hash.
        
        If you have the 'guess-language' python package installed, GuessIt can also
        analyze a subtitle file's contents and detect which language it is written in.
        
        If you have the 'enzyme' python package installed, GuessIt can also detect the
        properties from the actual video file metadata.
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
        
            $ pip install guessit
        
        or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::
        
            $ easy_install guessit
        
        But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/other-tools.html#pip-compared-to-easy-install>`_.

          the http://guessit.io/guess url
        * Command-line util can now report bugs to the http://guessit.io/bugs service
          by specifying the ``-b`` or ``--bug`` flag
        * GuessIt can now use the Enzyme python package to detect metadata out of the
          actual video file metadata instead of the filename
        * Finished transition to ``babelfish.Language`` and ``babelfish.Country``
        * New property: ``duration`` which returns the duration of the video in seconds
          This requires the Enzyme package to work

          text (instead of filename)
        * Added properties formatters and validators
        * Removed support for python 3.2
