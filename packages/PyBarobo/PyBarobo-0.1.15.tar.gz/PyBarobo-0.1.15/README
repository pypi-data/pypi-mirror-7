The Barobo Python Module

This python module can be used to control Barobo robots. The easiest way to use
this package is in conjunction with BaroboLink. After connecting to the robots
you want to control in BaroboLink, the following python program will move
joints 1 and 3 on the first connected Linkbot in BaroboLink::

  from barobo import Linkbot
  linkbot = Linkbot()
  linkbot.connect()
  linkbot.moveTo(180, 0, -180)

You may also use this package to control Linkbots without BaroboLink. In that
case, a typical control program will look something like this::
  from barobo import Linkbot, Dongle

  dongle = Dongle()
  dongle.connectDongleTTY('COM3')  # where 'COM3' is the com port the Linkbot is 
                                # connected on. In Windows, the COM port of the
                                # Linkbot can be identified by inspecting the
                                # Device Manager. On a Mac, the com port will
                                # appear in the "/dev/" directory, usually as
                                # something like "/dev/cu.usbmodem1d11". In
                                # Linux, it should be something like 
                                # "/dev/ttyACM0".
  linkbot = dongle.getLinkbot() # or linkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('2B2C') where '2B2C'
                             # should be replaced with the serial ID of your 
                             # Linkbot. Note that the serial ID used here can
                             # be that of a nearby Linkbot that you wish to 
                             # connect to wirelessly. If no serial ID is 
                             # provided, the new linkbot will refer to the 
                             # Linkbot currently connected via USB.
  linkbot.moveTo(180, 0, -180)
