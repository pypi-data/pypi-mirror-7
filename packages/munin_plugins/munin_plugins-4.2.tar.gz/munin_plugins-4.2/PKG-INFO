Description: ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Python >= 2.7
        - psutil for Python
        - Monit
        - Munin-node
        - Nginx
        
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        Install Egg
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        As usual, egg is installable using setuptools or pip, choice what you like. 
        It is better and strongly suggested to use a virtualenv.
            
        ~~~~~~~
        Install 
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The fast way to install, is using generate.py. To use, simply call generate script
        in bin directory.
        
        # <virtualenv_path>/bin/generate
        
        It will test the environment and configure cache folders. For every sensor, it will
        ask a confirm. Every sensor creates in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d a single configuration.
        If you want to check/change, that is the place.  
                
        Restart munin-node, munin-async (if you use that) and enjoy.

        ~~~~~~~~~
        Configure
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Usually a manual configuration is not required, but in some case you have to modify 
        some path or else. All munin plugins ask by they self during installation what 
        they need, and they write in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d. Keep attention if you reinstall
        using generate script because all setup will be overwriten.
        
        For apache and nginx, you have to configure log file format using combined2:
        
        Apache: LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" [[%D]]" combined2
        
        Nginx: log_format combined2 '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  '
                            '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                            '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" [[$request_time]]';
        
        After combined2 definition, you have to change your virtualhost configuration using 
        this format instead of usual "combined".

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Known Problems
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1 - Keep attection if you use SELinux or other kind of Security access framework,
        because you have to configure all rights correctly. Usually, my choice is to
        put down, because the call of monit get error about access denied.
