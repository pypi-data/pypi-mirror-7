Description: ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Python >= 2.7
        - psutil for Python
        - Monit
        - Munin-node
        - Nginx
        
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        Install Egg
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        As usual, egg is installable using setuptools or pip, choice what you like. 
        It is better and strongly suggested to use a virtualenv.
        
        ~~~~~~~~~
        Configure
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Once you get a virtualenv with munin_plugins installed, you can access to 
        
        <virtualenv_path>/var/munin_plugins/munin_plugins.conf 
        
        an modify the main options as nginx/munin/monit locations.
        
        To use nginx_full sensor, you need to add a new log format in Nginx as following
        
            log_format combined2 '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  '
                            '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                            '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" [[$request_time]]';
        
        You can get a file to add in conf.d nginx directory in 
        
        <virtualenv_path>/var/munin_plugins/config_nginx
        
        After that, you have to change nginx access_log directive from combined to combined2
          
        access_log /some/where/<somename>.log combined2;
            
        ~~~~~~~
        Install 
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The fast way to install, is using generate.py. The help can show you the options
        
        # generate -h 
        
        USAGE:
                generate [opts]
        
          Options:
                -h, --help:     show this help
                -f:             force creation of all symlinks without asking
                -n:             force creation of new symlinks without asking
        
        If you call generate.py without arguments, you will have to answers to a question
        for every symlink. 
                
        Restart munin-node, munin-async (if you use that) and enjoy.

        Known Problems
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1 - Keep attection if you use SELinux or other kind of Security access framework,
        because you have to configure all rights correctly. Usually, my choice is to
        put down, because the call of monit get error about access denied.
