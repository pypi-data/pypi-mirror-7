        =====================
        
          *by Martin Aspeli*
        
        RichDocument is a document type which provides the same fields as the standard
        Plone Document/Page type, but allows users to upload images directly into the
        document during editing.
        
        A RichDocument is a folderish type with Image and File as the only permitted
        contained types. Two special widgets for managing contained images and
        attachments are provided near the bottom of the edit form, though you have
        to expand a collapsed fieldset to see them.
        
        Once uploaded, images and attachments can be referenced in the document's body
        text or inserted using editors such as kupu.
        
        In addition, the user can optionally either automatically float the topmost
        uploaded image at the top left of the page, or display a box of thumbnails
        floating at the right of the page, on which the viewer can click to open
        the full-size image in a pop-up window. This is achieved using the Plone 2.1
        'display' menu.
        
        RichDocument is released under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2.
        Please see http://gnu.org for more details.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install in the usual way, using the QuickInstaller or Plone's Add/Remove
        Products control panel.
        
        This version works with Plone 3 and 4 only. Version 2.0 works with 2.1 and
        2.5. Version 1.0 works with Plone 2.0.
        
        Please see the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more
        information.

        Acknowlegements
        ===============
        The ImagesManagerWidget was originally created for km|portal, a knowledge
        management system aimed at small businesses (c) 2004 Martin Aspeli.
        
        RichDocument extends ATContentTypes. Thanks to Christian Heimes, Alec
        Mitchell and everyone else who made this such a useful framework.
        
        The RichDocument view templates are derived from Plone's document_view.
        The FileAttachment and ImageAttachment view templates are derived from
        Plone's file_view and image_view templates respectively.
        
        Dorneles Tremea contributed with some patches and added the i18n
        infrastructure.
        
        Known Issues and Potential Improvements
        =======================================
        
        - The templates use presentational markup and style attributes in some
          places and could do with a cleanup.
        
        - It's not possible to upload images while the object is still in the
          portal_factory. If the object is in the factory while it is being edited for
          the first time and the user uploads an image, it will be instantiated into
          the target folder first.
        
        - The image and attachment controls are submit buttons, managed via
          PortalFormController with custom actions registered during the installation.
          However, this button comes before the Save button on the form, and thus may
          steal the default button status - if the user presses Enter in the form, they
          may get a (benevolent) portal error message telling them they must upload an
          image.
        
        - The only re-ordering support provided directly by the manager widgets
          is "move to top". This is useful in support of the single-image preview mode
          or to make an attachment in the attachments download box stand out, but more
          detailed re-ordering functionality may be desirable.
