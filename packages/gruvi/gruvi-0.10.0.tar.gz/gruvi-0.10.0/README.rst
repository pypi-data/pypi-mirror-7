Welcome to Gruvi
================

Gruvi is an IO library for Python. It combines the efficiencies of event-based
I/O with a sequential programming model. Gruvi uses libuv_ (via pyuv_) as the
underlying high-performance event-based I/O layer, and used coroutines based on
fibers_ to create a traditional sequential programming model on top of the
libuv_ event-based callback model.

Gruvi is similar in concept to asyncio_, gevent_, and eventlet_. For a
rationale on why I've created a new library, see the Rationale_ section in the
manual.

Features
--------

Gruvi has the following features:

 * Excellent platform support (mostly thanks to libuv). Linux, Mac OSX and
   Windows are all first-class citizens. On Windows IOCP is used meaning that
   you don't run into the scalability limitations of ``select()`` there.
 * Small core and focus on low memory usage and fast performance. This makes
   Gruvi very suitable for mobile applications and embedded web servers.
 * Great support for SSL, also on Windows. Includes an SSL backports module
   that makes certain 3.x features available on Python 2.x.
 * Built-in client/server support for HTTP, JSON-RPC and D-BUS.
 * PEP-3156 compatible transport/protocol interface.
 * Transparent concurrency support. Thanks to fibers, calling into a blocking
   function is just like calling into a regular function.
 * Thread synchronization primitives including locks, conditions and queues.
 * Thread and fiber pools with a ``concurrent.futures`` interface.

CI Status
---------

.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/geertj/gruvi.png
    :target: http://travis-ci.org/geertj/gruvi

Example
-------

An simple echo server, using a StreamServer_::

  import gruvi

  def echo_handler(stream, transport, protocol):
      while True:
          buf = stream.read1()
          if not buf:
              break
          stream.write(buf)

  server = gruvi.StreamServer(echo_handler)
  server.listen(('localhost', 7777))
  gruvi.get_hub().switch()


Requirements
------------

You need Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3+.

The following operating systems are currently tested:

 * Posix (Only Linux is currently tested)
 * Mac OSX
 * Windows

Installation
------------

Development install in a virtualenv::

  $ git clone https://github.com/geertj/gruvi
  $ cd gruvi
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ python setup.py build
  $ python setup.py install

To run the test suite::

  $ python runtests.py unit

For other installation options, see the Installation_ section in the manual.
