****************************************
Transports and protocols (low-level API)
****************************************

.. currentmodule:: gruvi

Gruvi is built around the transport/protocol abstraction layers that are
documented in :pep:`3156` and implemented by asyncio_.

A transport is a standard interface to a communications channel. Different
types of channels implement different interfaces. Since Gruvi uses libuv_ /
pyuv_, its transports are mostly wrappers around the various
:class:`pyuv.Handle` classes. Transport methods are always non-blocking.

A protocol is a callback based interface that is connected to a transport. The
transport calls specific callbacks on the protocol when specific events occur.
The callbacks are always non-blocking, but a protocol may expose certain
protocol operations are part of their API that are switch points.

As a programmer you will use transports and protocols occasionally, but you
will mostly use the higher-level interface provided by Gruvi. The exception is
when adding support for a new protocol.

 
Transports
==========

The following transport classes are available:

.. autoexception:: TransportError()

.. autoclass:: BaseTransport()
    :members:

.. autoclass:: Transport
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

.. autoclass:: DatagramTransport
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

SSL/TLS support
===============

SSL and TLS support is available by means of a special :class:`SslTransport`
transport:

.. autoclass:: SslTransport
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

.. attribute:: HAVE_SSL_BACKPORTS

    A boolean that indicates whether the certain Python 3.x SSL feature are
    available on Python 2.x as well. This requires the presence of a C
    extension module that is compiled when Gruvi is installed. This attribute
    should be set to ``True`` on all platforms expect Windows where the C
    extension is not normally compiled.

    The features that require the SSL backports module are
    
    * Setting or quering the compression of an SSL connection.
    * Setting or querying the ciphers of an SSL connection (on Python 2.6).
    * Setting the anonymous Diffie Hellman parameters.
    * Querying the SSL channel bindings.

    On Python 3.x this is always set to ``False`` as the SSL backports are not
    needed there.

.. autofunction:: create_ssl_context


Protocols
=========

A Protocols is a collection of named callbacks. A protocol is are attached to a
transport, and its callbacks are called by the transport when certain events
happen.

The following protocol classes are available:

.. autoexception:: ProtocolError

.. autoclass:: BaseProtocol
    :members:

.. autoclass:: Protocol
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

.. autoclass:: DatagramProtocol
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

The following class does not exist in :pep:`3156` but is a useful base class
for most protocols:

.. autoclass:: MessageProtocol
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

Creating transports and protocols
=================================

Transports and protocols operate in pairs; there is always exactly one protocol
for each transport. A new transport/protocol pair can be created using the
factory functions below:

.. autofunction:: gruvi.create_connection

.. autofunction:: gruvi.create_server

Endpoints
=========

Endpoints wrap transports and protocols for client and server side connections,
and provide a more object-oriented way of working with them.

.. autoclass:: gruvi.Endpoint
    :members:

.. autoclass:: gruvi.Client
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

.. autoclass:: gruvi.Server
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:
