            <h3>About MyInboxIsNotA.TV</h3>
            <p>
            MyInboxIsNotA.TV is an email service that let's you subscribe to
            marketing newsletters that you're forced to accept, but filter
            them for HTML, web bugs, spam, and other things you don't want.

            It is another demonstration of the <a href="https://github.com/moggers87/salmon">Salmon Project</a>
            and is free for now.
            </p>

            <h2>Strip, Cleanse, And Read</h2>

            <p>
            The sad thing is, marketing people think about your Inbox like it's
            a TV.  They desperately want to send you their HTML marketing material
            so you are forced to view it.  They believe that the fraction of a second
            you spend viewing their 1990's styled HTML marketing will convert you
            to a paying customer.
            Successful companies know this isn't a long-term way to develop a 
            customer base, but other companies need help figuring this out.
            </p>


            <p>
            MyInboxIsNotA.TV is a simple service to let you subscribe to any corporate
            mailing list or service without receiving their HTML spam.  You give
            them a proxy address from MyInboxIsNotA.TV and it will filter any HTML leaving
            you with just nice clean text to read.  We'll block spam, stop web
            bugs, and even flag their stuff with a special header so you can 
            filter it further.
            </p>

            <p>Stay tuned for the launch in the next few days.</p>
