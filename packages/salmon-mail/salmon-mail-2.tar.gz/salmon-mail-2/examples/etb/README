OSB is a Email-To-Blog application that makes blog pages for people
using email messages.  It is meant as a demonstration of the newer
routing and Salmon design until we can update the mailing list
application.

To try it do this:

salmon log
salmon start
nosetests
mutt -F muttrc
mutt -F pendingrc

Then you'll see all the gear.  You can use mutt -F muttrc to actually
interact with the running server.
