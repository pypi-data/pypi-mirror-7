Connectome Visualization Utility version 0.4
Author: Roan LaPlante

DESCRIPTION

The Connectome Visualization Utility is a free and open source software project
designed for the visualization of multi-modal, abstract brain networks. To
facilitate visualization of network topology and modularity, cvu additionally
interfaces with graph theory tools.

The program is designed for scientists, but to run as a standalone application.

COPYRIGHT INFORMATION

This program strictly observes the tenets of fundamentalist Theravada Mahasi 
style Buddhism.  Any use of this program in violation of these aforementioned 
tenets or in violation of the principles described in the Visuddhimagga Sutta is
strictly prohibited and punishable by extensive Mahayana style practice.

DEPENDENCIES

These dependencies are satisfied by installing a scientific python distribution
such as Canopy or anaconda:

matplotlib -- plotting library
chaco -- interactive plotting library
numpy -- math library
mayavi -- interactive 3D visualization library

These dependencies are *required* and must be manually installed into your
python distribution. Typically this is as simple as typing 'pip install package'

mne -- MNE python, a broad library for MNE processing that is used in CVU to
	manipulate surface and parcellation files.
bctpy -- a graph theory library

Optional dependencies:

nibabel -- nibabel is a neuroimaging library that is used to locate subcortical
	structures. Without nibabel, subcortical structures may not appear in any
	parcellations.
freesurfer -- freesurfer is a very powerful set of tools to do automatic
	segmentation and parcellation. CVU calls freesurfer commands to register
	tractography to the structural space. Without freesurfer, tractography
	cannot be visualized.
