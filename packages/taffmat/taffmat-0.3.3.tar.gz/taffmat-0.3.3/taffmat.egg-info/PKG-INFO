        About the TAFFmat file format
        -----------------------------
        
        TAFFmat is Teac's proprietary file format used to store data from their
        LX series and other data recorders.
        
        According to the Teac "LX Series Recording Unit Instruction Manual":
        
            TAFFmat (an acronym for Teac Data Acquisition File Format) is a file
            format composed of the following:
        
            -  a data file containing A/D (analog to digital) converted data.
               The file is binary format with the extension dat.
            -  a header file containing information such as recording
               conditions. The file is in text format with the extension hdr.
        
        TAFFmat is a trademark of Teac Corporation.

        Contributing
        ------------
        
        `taffmat <https://github.com/questrail/taffmat>`__ is developed using
        `Scott Chacon <http://scottchacon.com/about.html>`__'s `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__. To
        contribute, fork `taffmat <https://github.com/questrail/taffmat>`__,
        create a feature branch, and then submit a pull request. `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__ is
        summarized as:
        
        -  Anything in the ``master`` branch is deployable
        -  To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
           ``master`` (e.g., ``new-oauth2-scopes``)
        -  Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the
           same named branch on the server
        -  When you need feedback or help, or you think the brnach is ready for
           merging, open a `pull
           request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`__.
        -  After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you
           can merge it into master.
        -  Once it is merged and pushed to ``master``, you can and *should*
           deploy immediately.
