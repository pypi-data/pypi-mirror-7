What's this?
------------

Go to `minilock.io <https://minilock.io>`__ to learn more about
miniLock. *deadlock* is an implementation of the miniLock protocol, and
as such it is compatible with miniLock. You can send and receive files
from people using miniLock without having to install Chrome (closed
source, spyware-rich browser) or Chromium (technically open source but
by-default-still-pretty-invasive browser).

In addition to the base function of sending and receiving miniLock'd
files, which ought to be secure against snooping eyes on the wire and to
provide you and your loved/liked/other ones with a measure of deserved
human privacy, *deadlock* comes with some other features you might like:

-  Auto-zipping of directories when encrypting, making it easy to send
   folders to friends.
-  Fast underlying C implementations of core miniLock algorithms.
-  Written for ease of use as a Python module, not only as a standalone
   application.
-  No browser, easily scripted, automated or pipelined.
-  "Petnames" allowing you to save IDs as easily-memorable friend names
   or emails
-  *Highly insecure* private key storage, allowing trivial
   encryption/decryption, including iterating through all local private
   keys and attempting decryption with each.
-  Early features for throwaway ultra-high-security addresses.
-  Early features for "vanity" addresses starting or ending in a chosen
   word (warning: may take until heat-death of the universe)

How do I install/use this?
--------------------------

*deadlock* is, at present, a Terminal only application, written in and
for Python 3 (may only work on versions 3.3 and above; poorly tested).
The best way to install it is to use pip:

::

    sudo pip install deadlock

..provided that you have the necessary system-level dependencies (C
compiler and supporting libraries), this ought to pull in the required
cryptographic modules from PyPI and build them, then install *deadlock*.

Once installed, *deadlock* will be available as a Python module and also
as a script, ``deadlock``. Try ``deadlock --help`` for guidance on
usage.

*deadlock* will probably work on any platform with a C compiler for the
required modules, but I have no interest in supporting closed,
spyware-rich operating systems like WinMac, so don't ask. If it doesn't
work on those platforms, then you can always fix it and send me a pull
request. I don't accept pull requests for legacy support (e.g. Python
versions prior to 3.2), sorry; the code gets too messy.

Who do I contact for support or to complain?
--------------------------------------------

Nobody. This software is provided without warranty of any kind. It
works, for me, and I'm pretty sure it's secure, but I'm not going to
certify it as such and you shouldn't use it if you really need security
to protect you from people with the means and motive to harm or imprison
you.

Directions
----------

Planned, desired or future features:

-  Tidier API for alternative uses of the miniLock encryption format,
   for P2P or mail client tie-in, or for RPC message passing.
-  Cleaner code structure; break lots of functionality out of
   crypto.py/core.py into a new utils.py file, make core.py "dumb glue
   code" only.
-  Fully integrate high-security keys and vanity keys, including
   multiprocessing for facilitating vanity key generation on multi-core
   machines. Estimated progress summaries for vanity key generation;
   time until statistically expected result, etc.
-  Pure-Python fallbacks for some cryptographic dependencies for
   platforms that pose a challenge to native C compilation; Android,
   embedded platforms, etc.

Not currently planned:

-  Contemplated adding extensions to the fileInfo dictionary within
   decryptInfo entries, but doing so would change the length of these
   entries which are at present highly predictable; this would mean that
   decryptInfo length could be used to infer which software was used to
   create a miniLock file, whether miniLock or deadlock. So, don't
   suggest such features, as they would partially compromise anonymity.
-  Future versions of miniLock protocol ought to include a "mimeType"
   fileInfo key to hint to recipients whether a miniLock file is a
   plaintext item to be displayed, or a file to be saved; doing so would
   facilitate email integration of miniLock as a potential PGP
   successor. Again as above, such extensions would at present
   compromise anonymity somewhat.
