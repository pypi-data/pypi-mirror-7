1.3.3
-----

1.3.3 fixes a simple issue with the reported version number.

Also note that nose 1.x is in maintenance mode.  We will not be
looking to add any features, and you should seriously consider
looking at nose2 as the way forward.

If you're interested in the future of nose, please take a look at the
nose2 project on github (https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) or pypi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose2/0.4.7).

And lastly if you have the money to spare, please consider donating to
the John Hunter memorial fund (http://numfocus.org/johnhunter/). We
all give up time with our families to work on free software: so now
the free software community that has benefited so much from that
time we took can give something back to his family.
