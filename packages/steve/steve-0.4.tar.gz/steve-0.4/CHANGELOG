 ChangeLog
===========

version 0.4 -- August 5th, 2014
===============================

**Changes**

* **added steve.richardapi.get_video**
* **Tweaks to webedit to make it a little easier to use**
* **added steve.utils.fetch_videos_from_url**


version 0.3 -- March 17th, 2014
===============================

**API Changes**

* **steve.richardapi functions changed signatures**

  The new functions match the new v2 richard api. These involve
  sending just an auth token---no more sending an auth token and
  a username.

* **steve.richardapi.MissingRequiredData changed**

  If you were missing data, you could look at the ``errors`` attribute
  of the ``MissingDataRequired`` exception for details. That was dumb
  and difficult. Now it's just part of the message. So you can do this::

     try:
         # do something wrogn
     except MissingRequiredData as exc:
         print exc


* **nixed steve.richardapi.create_category_if_missing**

  I think this was causing too many problems. You now have to create
  the category on the server.

**Other Changes**

* **bug fixes**


version 0.2 -- March 17th, 2013
===============================

**API Changes**

* **changed steve.util.verify_json to steve.util.verify_video_data**

  The previous function name was a misnomer---it takes a Python
  dict as an argument and has nothing to do with JSON.


**Other Changes**

* **added steve.restapi**

  Basic REST client to talk to richard instances.

* **added steve.richardapi**

  Added the richardapi module which has some functions that make
  it easier to do richard API things

* **added steve.util.html_to_markdown**

  Since richard and pyvideo now use Markdown for summaries and
  descriptions, it helps to have a converter.

* **added webedit command of awesome**

  steve now has a webedit command that lets you edit JSON files
  in a web-based editor.


version 0.1 -- January 13th, 2013
=================================

* **First version, so everything is new.**

  See documentation for features and how to use it!
