js.jquery_fileupload
********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery File Upload`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery File Upload`: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_fileupload``) are published to some URL.
