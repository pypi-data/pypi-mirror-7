Description: Flask-Manifest
        ==============
        
        This plugin aims to help integrate any asset pipeline that generates a static
        file manifest with Flask.
        
        While it's a work in progress and the API is not finalised, I'm currently using
        it for a project. As this project evolves, the extension's scope and eventual
        features will become more concrete.
