Description: An SDL2 wrapper made with cffi. Faster on pypy.
        
        Adapted from headers & wrapper functions from
        libSDL2,
        https://github.com/torch/sdl2-ffi,
        https://bitbucket.org/duangle/pysdl-cffi, and
        PySDL2.
        
        The goal is to provide a flat, consistent, faithful-to-C binding with some
        more-Pythonic renaming and conveniences.
        
        This wrapper won't contain anything that doesn't directly translate to part of
        the library's API. The goal is to be a dependency for something like pygame,
        not a replacement.
