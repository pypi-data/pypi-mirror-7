        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product on a buildout based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``s17.taskmanager`` to the list of eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                s17.taskmanager
            zcml =
                s17.taskmanager
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``s17.taskmanager`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
