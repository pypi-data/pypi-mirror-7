Version 0.7.2
=============

* Added backward compatibility with Python 2.7 (issue #34).
* Added Java parameter annotation 'output' (issue #36).
  This is used to optimise passing Python buffer arguments where Java primitive arrays are expected.
* Removed debugging prints of the form "JNI_OnLoad: ..."
* Corrected documentation of jpy.array(type, init) function, which was said to be jpy.array(type, length)
* Removed console dumps that occurred when calling from Java proxies into Python
* Updated Java API documentation and added it to Sphinx doc folder (doc/_static/java-apidoc)
* Added new diagnostic F_ERR flag to Java class PyLib.Diag
* Java class PyLib is no longer instantiable


Version 0.7.1
=============

* Updated README and added MANIFEST.in after recognising that the jpy-0.7.zip distribution misses most of the
  required source files and learning what to do on this case.


Version 0.7.0
=============

* Initial version.
