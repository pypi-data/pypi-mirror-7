Description: Yo Python
        =====
        
        A Python client for the Yo platform. This is pretty pointless, but I want to try to overengineer it as much as possible, just for fun.

        Installation
        ==
        
        `pip install python-yo`
        
        Usage
        ==
        
        ````
        import yo
        
        API_TOKEN = '...'
        
        yo_client = yo.Yo(API_TOKEN)
        
        yo_client.yo()     # Send a Yo to all your subscribers
        
        yo_user = 'mcos'
        
        yo_client.yo(username=yo_user)     # Send a Yo to a specific user
        
        ````
        
        Roadmap
        ==
        
        Since I want to overengineer this in the future, the following needs to be done:
        
        * Full test coverage
        * Travis integration
        * Updated documentation
        * A landing page on Github pages
        * Full git-flow workflow
