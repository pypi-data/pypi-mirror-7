Description: 
        Shiva
        =====
        
        Shiva is, technically speaking, a RESTful API to your music collection. It
        indexes your music and exposes an API with the metadata of your files so you
        can then perform queries on it and organize it as you wish.
        
        On a higher level, however, Shiva aims to be a free (as in freedom and beer)
        alternative to popular music services. It was born with the goal of giving back
        the control over their music and privacy to the users, protecting them from the
        industry’s obsession with control.
        
        It’s not intended to compete directly with online music services, but to be an
        alternative that you can install and modify to your needs. You will own the
        music in your server. Nobody but you (or whoever you give permission) will be
        able to delete files or modify the files’ metadata to correct it when it’s
        wrong. And of course, it will all be available to any device with Internet
        connection.
        
        You will also have a clean, RESTful API to your music without restrictions. You
        can grant access to your friends and let them use the service or, if they have
        their own Shiva instances, let both servers talk to each other and share the
        music transparently.
        
        To sum up, Shiva is a distributed social network for sharing music.
