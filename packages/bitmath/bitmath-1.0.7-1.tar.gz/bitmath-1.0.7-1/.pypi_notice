bitmath
=======

*bitmath* simplifies many facets of interacting with file sizes in
various units. Functionality includes:

* Converting between **SI** and **NIST** prefix units (``GiB`` to ``kB``)
* Converting between units of the same type (SI to SI, or NIST to NIST)
* Basic arithmetic operations (subtracting 42KiB from 50GiB)
* Rich comparison operations (``1024 Bytes == 1KiB``)
* bitwise operations (``<<``, ``>>``, ``&``, ``|``, ``^``)
* Sorting
* Automatic human-readable prefix selection (like in `hurry.filesize <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.filesize>`_)

In addition to the conversion and math operations, `bitmath` provides
human readable representations of values which are suitable for use in
interactive shells as well as larger scripts and applications. The
format produced for these representations is customizable via the
functionality included in stdlibs `string.format
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html>`_.

In discussion we will refer to the NIST units primarily. I.e., instead
of "megabyte" we will refer to "mebibyte". The former is ``10^3 =
1,000,000`` bytes, whereas the second is ``2^20 = 1,048,576``
bytes. When you see file sizes or transfer rates in your web browser,
most of the time what you're really seeing are the base-2 sizes/rates.

**Don't Forget!** The source for bitmath `is available on GitHub
<https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath>`_.

OH! And did we mention it has 100+ unittests? `Check them out for
yourself <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/tree/master/tests>`_.

Examples
========

What good would a README be without examples?

Arithmetic
----------

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: from bitmath import *

   In [2]: log_size = kB(137.4)

   In [3]: log_zipped_size = Byte(987)

   In [4]: print "Compression saved %s space" % (log_size - log_zipped_size)
   Compression saved 136.413kB space

   In [5]: thumb_drive = GiB(12)

   In [6]: song_size = MiB(5)

   In [7]: songs_per_drive = thumb_drive / song_size

   In [8]: print songs_per_drive
   2457.6


Convert Units
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: from bitmath import *

   In [2]: dvd_size = GiB(4.7)

   In [3]: print "DVD Size in MiB: %s" % dvd_size.to_MiB()
   DVD Size in MiB: 4812.8MiB


Select a human-readable unit
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   In [4]: small_number = kB(100)

   In [5]: ugly_number = small_number.to_TiB()

   In [6]: print ugly_number
   9.09494701773e-08TiB

   In [7]: print ugly_number.best_prefix()
   97.65625KiB


Rich Comparison
---------------

.. code-block:: python

   In [8]: cd_size = MiB(700)

   In [9]: cd_size > dvd_size
   Out[9]: False

   In [10]: cd_size < dvd_size
   Out[10]: True

   In [11]: MiB(1) == KiB(1024)
   Out[11]: True

   In [12]: MiB(1) <= KiB(1024)
   Out[12]: True

Sorting
-------

.. code-block:: python

   In [13]: sizes = [KiB(7337.0), KiB(1441.0), KiB(2126.0), KiB(2178.0),
                     KiB(2326.0), KiB(4003.0), KiB(48.0), KiB(1770.0),
                     KiB(7892.0), KiB(4190.0)]

   In [14]: print sorted(sizes)
   [KiB(48.0), KiB(1441.0), KiB(1770.0), KiB(2126.0), KiB(2178.0),
   KiB(2326.0), KiB(4003.0), KiB(4190.0), KiB(7337.0), KiB(7892.0)]


Custom Formatting
-----------------

* Use of the custom formatting system
* All of the available instance properties

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   In [8]: longer_format = """Formatting attributes for %s
      ...: This instances prefix unit is {unit}, which is a {system} type unit
      ...: The unit value is {value}
      ...: This value can be truncated to just 1 digit of precision: {value:.1f}
      ...: In binary this looks like: {binary}
      ...: The prefix unit is derived from a base of {base}
      ...: Which is raised to the power {power}
      ...: There are {bytes} bytes in this instance
      ...: The instance is {bits} bits large
      ...: bytes/bits without trailing decimals: {bytes:.0f}/{bits:.0f}""" % str(ugly_number)

   In [9]: print ugly_number.format(longer_format)
   Formatting attributes for 5.96046447754MiB
   This instances prefix unit is MiB, which is a NIST type unit
   The unit value is 5.96046447754
   This value can be truncated to just 1 digit of precision: 6.0
   In binary this looks like: 0b10111110101111000010000000
   The prefix unit is derived from a base of 2
   Which is raised to the power 20
   There are 6250000.0 bytes in this instance
   The instance is 50000000.0 bits large
   bytes/bits without trailing decimals: 6250000/50000000
