        bitmath
        =======
        
        bitmath simplifies many facets of interacting with file sizes in
        various units. Examples include: converting between **SI** and
        **NIST** prefix units (*GiB* to *kB*), converting between units of the
        same type (SI to SI, or NIST to NIST), basic arithmetic operations
        (subtracting 42KiB from 50GiB), rich comparison operations (``1024
        Bytes == 1KiB``), bitwise operations (``<<``, ``>>``, ``&``, ``|``,
        ``^``), and sorting.
        
        In addition to the conversion and math operations, bitmath provides
        human readable representations of values which are suitable for use in
        interactive shells as well as larger scripts and applications.
        
        In discussion we will refer to the NIST units primarily. I.e., instead
        of "megabyte" we will refer to "mibibyte". The former is ``10^3 =
        1,000,000`` bytes, whereas the second is ``2^20 = 1,048,576``
        bytes. When you see file sizes in your file browser, or transfer rates
        in your web browser, what you're really seeing are the base-2
        sizes/rates.

        Basics
        ======
        
        ### Class Initializer Signature
        
            BitMathType([value=0, [bytes=None, [bits=None]]])
        
        A bitmath type may be initialized in four different ways:
        
        - Set no initial value
        
        The default size is 0
        
            zero_kib = KiB()
        
        - Set the value **in current prefix units**
        
        That is to say, if you want to encapsulate 1KiB, initialize the
        bitmath type with ``1``:
        
            one_kib = KiB(1)
        
        	one_kib = KiB(value=1)
        
        - Set the number of bytes
        
        Use the ``bytes`` keyword
        
            one_kib = KiB(bytes=1024)
        
        - Set the number of bits
        
        Use the ``bits`` keyword
        
            one_kib = KiB(bits=8192)
