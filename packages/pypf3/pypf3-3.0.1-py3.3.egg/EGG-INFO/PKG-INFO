        In general, integration calls are made using using REST-like web service calls. The 'requests' python package is used to do all HTTP requests.
        
        The application needs to run with "sudo" to ensure permissions required for file system manipulation apply.
        
        In order to make use of this code for production use, you need various authenticated access tokens and serial numbers to use the various applications.
