Release HOWTO
=============

To make a release:

1. Update release date/version in NEWS.txt and setup.py
2. Run 'python setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist'
3. Test the generated source distribution in dist/
4. Upload to PyPI: 'python setup.py egg_info -RDb "" sdist upload'
5. Increase version in setup.py (for next release)

Note that if you ignore the ``egg_info -RDb ""`` part, Distribute will generate
a development release tarball with ``.dev``.

Instead of "" you may want "rc1" and such.
