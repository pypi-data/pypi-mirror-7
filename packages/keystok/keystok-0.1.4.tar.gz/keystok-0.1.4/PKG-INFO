Description: =====================
        Keystok Python Client
        =====================
        
        This tool provides shell access to Keystok from Linux, OS X and other
        UNIX-like operating systems. It can be used e.g. inside Docker containers
        to access Keystok keys.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install the Python client, run this in your shell:
        
            pip install keystok
        
        You can do it inside a virtualenv if needed.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Run "keystok -h" for help on the available commands and options.
        
        Specifying the access token
        ---------------------------
        
        To configure the access token, first run this in the shell:
        
            export KEYSTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access token from keystok.com>
        
        Alternatively you can also specify the token in each command using:
        
            keystok -a <token>
        
        In Dockerfiles you might want to use the convenient ENV directive:
        
            ENV KEYSTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN <access token from keystok.com>
        
        Or to keep it out of the Dockerfile, specify it with docker run instead:
        
            docker run -e KEYSTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access token>
        
        It's also possible to place the access token in one of these files:
        
            ./.keystok/access_token (under current directory)
            ~/.keystok/access_token (under home directory)
        
        Commands
        --------
        
        To list all keys associated with the application:
        
            keystok ls
        
        To retrieve a key and output it into stdout:
        
            keystok get <keyid>
        
        To automatically retrieve ssh keys and generate a ssh configuration:
        
            keystok sshautoconfig
