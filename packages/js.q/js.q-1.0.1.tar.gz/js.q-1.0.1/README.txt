js.q
****

Introduction
============

This library packages `q`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`q`: http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.q``) are published to some URL.
