A set of Python modules and utility programmes to deal with Replay Gain
information -- calculate it (with GStreamer), read and write it (with Mutagen).
It has support for Ogg Vorbis (or probably anything stored in an Ogg
container), Flac, WavPack, MP4 (aka AAC) and MP3 (in different incarnations).
Thereâ€˜s also a command-line programme, ``replaygain``, that works very similar
to its like-named cousins, most prominently ``vorbisgain`` and ``mp3gain`` --
only that itworks for all those supported formats alike. ``collectiongain``
on the other hand is a kind of fire-and-forget tool for big amounts of music
files.
