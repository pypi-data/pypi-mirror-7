Pyrene is about treating Python package repositories equal.


Thoughts
========

Package repositories contain and serve packages securely (at least they should).

Local directories with a bunch of packages work.

There is great need for private repositories with restricted access.


Features
========

Configure pip (by writing a `~/.pip/pip.conf` file) to use a repo without
`--index-url` or `--find-links` command line options::

    $ pyrene use repo

Serve a directory for quick & direct package exchange over http::

    $ pyrene serve dir-repo

Populate a repo from another repository::

    $ pyrene copy source-repo:package-with-lots-of-dependencies destination-repo:

Shell for configuration and interactive operations::

    $ pyrene
    ...
    Pyrene: directory_repo local
    Pyrene[local]: set directory=/path/to/repo
    Pyrene[local]: copy pypi:someinterestingpkg==0.1 local:
    Pyrene[local]: work_on private
    Pyrene[private]: copy local:someinterestingpkg private:
    Pyrene[private]: help use
    ...
