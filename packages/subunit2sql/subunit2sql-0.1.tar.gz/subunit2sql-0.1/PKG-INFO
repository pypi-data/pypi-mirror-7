Description: subunit2SQL README
        ==================
        
        subunit2SQL like it's name implies is a tool used for converting subunit
        streams to data in a SQL database. The motivation is that for multiple 
        distributed test runs that are generating subunit output it is useful to
        store the results in a unified repository. This is the motivation for the
        testrepository project which does a good job for centralizing the results from
        multiple test runs.
        
        However, imagine something like the OpenStack CI system where the same basic
        test suite is normally run several hundreds of times a day. To provide useful
        introspection on the data from those runs and to build trends over time
        the test results need to be stored in a format that allows for easy querying.
        Using a SQL database makes a lot of sense for doing this.
        
        subunit2SQL uses alembic migrations to setup a DB schema that can then be used
        by the subunit2sql binary to parse subunit streams and populate the DB. 
        Additionally, it provides a DB API that can be used to query information from
        the results stored to build other tooling.
