Description: ===============================
        Integrate django CMS with Oscar
        ===============================
        
        ``djangocms-oscar`` eases integration between the content management system
        django CMS and the e-commerce framework Oscar.
        
        It is in an early stage, so use at your own risk.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - ``base.html`` template which means that the django CMS toolbar works both on
          CMS pages and Oscar views
        - Ships with default CMS templates that share the look with Oscar's sandbox
          pages
        - Oscar's "Browse store" dropdown includes CMS pages
        - A "Featured product" CMS plugin to be able to add individual products on
          CMS pages
        
        Tested with
        ===========
        
        * django-cms 3.0.2
        * django-oscar >=0.7.1, <0.8
        * Django 1.5.8
        * Python 2.7
        
        NOTE: Currently, django CMS does not play well with the new @atomic decorator
        introduced in Django 1.6. Use django CMS from the master branch, or wait for
        the next release.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Grabbing the integration
        ------------------------
        The latest release will be on PyPi, so you can just 
        ``pip install djangocms-oscar``. Or grab it from the ``master`` branch if you
        prefer the bleeding edge.
        
        Adding django CMS to an Oscar project
        -------------------------------------
        
        If you have a working Oscar project and want to add django CMS, follow the
        instructions on `integrating django CMS`_.
        
        You should also add at least one plugin to be able to set content. This
        probably want to add `djangocms-text-ckeditor`_ to be able to include text.

        Adding Oscar to a django CMS project
        ------------------------------------
        
        If you have a working django CMS project and want to integrate Oscar, follow
        the instructions on `getting started with Oscar`_.
        
        .. _getting started with Oscar: http://django-oscar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/internals/getting_started.html
        
        URLs
        ----
        
        There's two options to include Oscar's URLs.
        
        This integration comes with an app hook for django CMS. So you can just let
        django CMS take care of URL handling by adding Oscar to a CMS page.
        
        If you prefer to hard-wire Oscar's URLs into your project's ``urls.py``,
        make sure that django CMS's URLs come after Oscar's.urls::
        
             urlplatterns = [
                ...
                (r'^shop/', include(shop.urls)),
                (r'^', include('cms.urls')),
                ...
             ]
        
        Setting up the integration
        --------------------------
        
        To get started using ``djangocms-oscar``:
        
        - install it with ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install djangocms-oscar
        
        - add the plugins to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'djangocms_oscar',
                ...
            )
        
        - To use the supplied templates, they need to be loaded before Oscar's::
        
            from oscar import OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR
            from djangocms_oscar import OSCAR_CMS_TEMPLATE_DIR
        
            TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
                location('templates'),
                OSCAR_CMS_TEMPLATE_DIR,
                OSCAR_MAIN_TEMPLATE_DIR,
            )
        
        - Run ``syncdb`` or ``migrate`` if you're using South.
        
        Optional settings
        -----------------
        
        Besides customised Oscar templates, ``djangocms-oscar`` comes with a set of
        CMS templates that are based on Oscar's default templates.
        They're a good starting point and can be used like this::
        
            # settings.py
        
            CMS_TEMPLATES = (
                ('djangocms_oscar/full_width.html', 'Full width (no sidebars)'),
                ('djangocms_oscar/with_sidebar.html', 'Two column (left-hand sidebar)'),
            )
        
        If you want Oscar's homepage to be controlled by django CMS, set it like this::
        
            # settings.py
        
            from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy
            OSCAR_HOMEPAGE = reverse_lazy('pages-root')
