Description: Python United Intranet Core
        ===========================
        
        The PU core package offers JSON based views for Django to do inline
        actions in your front-end, or in other words: actions that result only
        in a small part of the page to be renewed to reflect the result of the
        action. Think: 'make favorite', 'tweet', etc. To enable this behavior,
        you can create a link in your html with the class "action-inline".
        
        Action results can be sent to a specific target, either an element id,
        or a jQuery expression. Callbacks are supported, appending to lists,
        etc. Check the JS file for details.
