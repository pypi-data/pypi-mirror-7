Inline actions
--------------

Inline actions are actions that are executed without refreshing the
page. To use this, provide your links with the class
"inline-action". If data needs to be submitted, use the data attribute
pu-action-data to provide a serialized representation of the data. The
action will execute the given url. If the target attribute is
provided, the result will be shown in that target, otherwise the link
that triggered the even will be replaced with the result. If target is
an element id, that jQuery element is selected. If it is a jQuery
expression, it is evaluated against the current link.
