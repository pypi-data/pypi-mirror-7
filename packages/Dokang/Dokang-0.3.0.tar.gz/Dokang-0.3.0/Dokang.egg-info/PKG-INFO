Description: Dokang is a lightweight search engine with a web frontend.
        
        Status: Dokang is fully functional and works for us but has a few
        limitations:
        
        - the indexing and search features are minimal. They work but could
          certainly be tweaked to be faster, provide better results or, who
          knows, both;
        
        - the two-file configuration is a bit unfortunate. The INI file is
          useful for WSGI servers but defining structured options is much
          easier in Python;
        
        - more generally, the configuration may be a bit discouraging.
          Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
        
        Change log
        ==========
        
        Dokang 0.3.0 (2014-07-04)
        -------------------------
        
        - Fixed bug in the HTML harvester. Trying to use it would fail with an
          exception because Whoosh would complain about something that
          unexpectedly is a byte string.
        
        - Fixed bug in the handling of deleted documents. They were not
          deleted from the index.
        
        
        Dokang 0.2.0 (2014-06-24)
        -------------------------
        
        Initial version.
