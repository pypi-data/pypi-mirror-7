Description: Elita
        =====
        
        Elita is an engine/framework for continuous deployment and API-driven infrastructure utilizing git
        and salt. Elita maps build packages to filesystem locations on an arbitrary number of remote servers and allows deployment
        (and more) via RESTful HTTP calls.
