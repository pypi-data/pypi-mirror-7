        Mobile Map Downloader
        #####################
        
        **Mobile Map Downloader** is a command line program to download maps from the
        Internet and install them on mobile devices, such as smart phones. 
        
        The program is intended to run on a (personal) computer, that has a fast and
        cheap Internet connection, and a large hard disk. The downloaded maps are
        stored on the personal computer. Only the maps that are used for the current
        activity need to be installed on the mobile device. When different maps are
        required for an other activity they can be quickly installed from the personal
        computer's hard disk, without lengthy downloads. 
        
        The software is currently in **beta state**. It can be productively used by
        adventurous people, or semi experts. Expect it to lack some functionality, to
        crash often, and to sometimes do unwanted things.
        
        Currently the offline map programs **OsmAnd** and **Oruxmaps** are supported: 
            
        * http://osmand.net/
        * http://www.oruxmaps.com/index_en.html
        
        Maps can be installed from **Osmand** and from **Openandromaps**, which means 
        there is currently only one source of maps for each program:
        
        * http://download.osmand.net/rawindexes/
        * http://www.openandromaps.org/downloads
        
        If you find any **errors**, or if you have good ideas for the program,
        please put them into the project's **issue tracker**:

        Installation
        =======================================
        
        The program has only been tested on **Linux**. It should run on **Mac OS X** and **Windows** with only minor modifications, however installation on these operating systems is probably more complicated.
        
        On **Linux**, open a terminal, get administrator/root privileges and type::
            
            pip install mobile-map-download --pre -U
        
        Alternatively you can install the program with **Virtualenv**. With Virtualenv
        you don't need root privileges, and can delete the program from your computer
        without a trace::
            
            virtualenv virtualenv/  #can use any name for the directory
            cd virtualenv
            source bin/activate
            pip install mobile-map-download --pre -U
        
        
        Usage
        =======================================
        
        List the maps of France, that the program can download::
        
            dlmap lss "*France*"
        
        Patterns with wildcards should be quoted, because the shell might fill them in. 
        
        Install maps of France for OsmAnd, on a certain device::
        
            dlmap -m /var/run/media/eike/1A042-B123/ install "osmand/France*"
         
        The program has a built in help facility, detailed information about its
        changing set of features has to be taken from it::
        
            dlmap -h
        
        Each subcommand has its own help message::
        
            dlmap install -h
        
        
        Development
        =======================================
        
        The program is written in the **Python** programming language, version **2.7**.
        Contributions of code are very welcome. The program has currently only been
        tested on **Linux**. It uses however no Linux specific functionality, so
        porting to other operating systems should be easy. 
        
        Development is coordinated on Github:
