        Mobile Map Downloader
        #####################
        
        Mobile Map Downloader is a command line program to download maps from the
        Internet and install them on mobile devices, such as smart phones. The program
        is intended to run on a (personal) computer, that has a fast and cheap Internet
        connection, and a large hard disk. The downloaded maps are also stored on the
        personal computer.
        
        The software is currently in **beta state**. It can be productively used by
        adventurous people, or semi experts. Expect it to lack some functionality, to
        crash often, and to sometimes do unwanted things.
        
        The program currently only supports **OsmAnd**: 
            
            http://osmand.net/
        
        If you find any **errors**, or if you have good ideas for the program,
        please put them into the project's **issue tracker**:

        Installation
        =======================================
        
        Open a terminal, get administrator/root privileges and type::
            
            pip install mobile-map-download --pre -U
        
        Alternatively you can install the program with **Virtualenv**. With Virtualenv
        you don't need root privileges, and can delete the program from your computer
        without a trace::
            
            virtualenv virtualenv/  #can use any name for the directory
            cd virtualenv
            source bin/activate
            pip install mobile-map-download --pre -U
        
        
        Usage
        =======================================
        
        List the maps of France, that the program can download::
        
            dlmap ls "*France*"
        
        Patterns with wildcards should be quoted, because the shell might fill them in. 
        
        Install maps of France for OsmAnd, on a certain device::
        
            dlmap -m /var/run/media/eike/1A042-B123/ install "osmand/France*"
         
        The program has a built in help facility, detailed information about its
        changing set of features has to be taken from it::
        
            dlmap -h
        
        Each subcommand has its own help message::
        
            dlmap install -h
        
        
        Development
        =======================================
        
        The program is written in the **Python** programming language, version **2.7**.
        Contributions of code are very welcome. The program has currently only been
        tested on **Linux**. It uses however no Linux specific functionality, so
        porting to other operating systems should be easy. 
        
        Development is coordinated on Github:
