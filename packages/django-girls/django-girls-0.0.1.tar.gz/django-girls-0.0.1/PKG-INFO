Description: 
        django-girls
        ============
        
        This is a simple package that simply requires the following packages:
        
            - django
            - gunicorn
            - dj-database-url
            - dj-static
        
        However, in order to deploy into Heroku, we would also need a packaged called
        "psycopg".
        
        So after virtual environment activation we need to run::
        
            pip install django-girls
        
        Then::
        
            pip freeze > requirements.txt
        
        And at least add "psycopg2" package manually by adding a file to the
        requirements.txt file. Open file "requirements.txt" and a line at the end of it::
        
            psycopg2==2.5.3
