        --------------------------------------------
        
        To make go:
        
        1. In conf.py::
            import osuosl_hieroglyph_theme
            html_theme = 'osuosl'  ##(must be changed in file)!
            html_theme_path = osuosl_hieroglyph_theme.get_html_theme_path()
            html_static_path = ['_static', html_theme_path + '/osuosl/static/'] ##(must be changed in file)
            slide_theme_options = {'custom_css' : 'osuosl.css'}
            slide_footer = "<img src='_static/logo.png'>"
        
        For the html_theme and html_static_path variables, you must find the defaults in the file and change them, as they will not be overridden by your declaration of them!
