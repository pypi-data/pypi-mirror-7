`diecutter` is a web application around file generation:

* templates are the resources ;

* the most common operation is to **POST data to templates in order to retrieve
  generated files**.

`diecutter` can render single files and directories. Directories are rendered
as archives.

   {{ greetings|default('Hello') }} {{ name }}!

``POST`` data to the template and retrieve generated content:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl -X POST -d name=world http://diecutter.io/api/greetings.txt

for details about the future.

Also notice that `diecutter` is part of an ecosystem:

* `piecutter`_ is the core Python API. It provides stuff like template engines
  or template loaders.

* `diecutter` implements a WSGI application and REST interface on top of
  `piecutter`.

* `diecutter-index <https://github.com/diecutter/diecutter-index>`_ is a
  proof-of-concept project for an online template registry.

* http://diecutter.io is the SAAS platform running `diecutter` ecosystem.
