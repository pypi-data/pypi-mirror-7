=============

Python based tools for interacting and developing against the Salesforce platform, currently WIP. 

Currently supports the Metadata, Tooling and Apex API. Also has a few useful utilities for interacting with the xml and responses. 


4/9/14 - Published a very minimal, hopefully stable release, and published it on PyPi. This contains a good amount of functionality, though may contain issues.
