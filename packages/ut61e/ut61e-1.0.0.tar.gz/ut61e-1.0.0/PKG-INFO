Description: ut61e (Python)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This is a Python package helping you to capture and interpret data from
        the digital multimeter Uni-T UT61E. You can easily install it via
        ``pip``.
        
        Tools which this package provides:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ``es51922.py`` – Interprets the output of the ES51922 chip
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        This utility interprets data sent by the Cyrustek ES51922 chip. It reads
        lines from stdin, tries to interpret them as messages from the chip and
        prints basic information on the stdout. In addition it writes a CSV file
        with a lot more information to the working directory.
        
        ``he2325u_hidapi.py`` – Reads from the USB/HID adapter cable using HIDAPI
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        This tool tries to read from the adapter cable using the HID API
        provided by the operating system. It relies on
        `cython-hidapi <https://github.com/trezor/cython-hidapi>`__.
        
        The tool is called after the original chip from the USB/HID cables which
        was the *Hoitek HE2325U*. Nowadays those cables come with a newer chip
        called *WCH CH9325* but the way to get data out of them didn't change.
        
        This tool prints its output to stdout so that you can directly pipe it
        into ``es51922.py``. Works on Linux and Mac OS X (Windows not tested)
        without root access. On Linux you may have to `create a udev
        rule <https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/blob/master/udev/99-hid.rules>`__
        in order to get access to the ``/dev/hidrawX`` device as a regular user.
        
        ``he2325u_pyusb.py`` – Reads from the USB/HID adapter cable using PyUSB
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        This tool is very much similar to ``he2325u_hidapi.py`` as it also
        allows to read from the USB/HID adapter cable. It also prints its output
        to stdout. It uses PyUSB instead of HIDAPI which in turn uses direct
        libusb calls to talk to the adapter. **Needs to be run as root.** Works
        on Linux only.
        
        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        This Python package is registered on PyPI with the name
        `ut61e <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ut61e>`__. To install it, simply
        run
        
        ::
        
            pip instal ut61e
        
        Usage
        ^^^^^
        
        To read data from the USB/HID adapter cable and interpret it as Cyrustek
        ES51922 information, you can do:
        
        ::
        
            he2325u_hidapi.py | es51922.py
        
        Requirements
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        You need either Python2 or Python3 to run this software.
        
        To analyze output using ``es51922.py`` you don't need any external
        modules.
        
        If you want to run ``he2325u_hidapi.py``, you need
        `cython-hidapi <https://github.com/trezor/cython-hidapi>`__.
        
        If you want to run ``he2325u_pyusb.py``, you need
        `PyUSB <https://github.com/walac/pyusb>`__.
        
        Software using this Package
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        I also wrote a web interface for the display of the UT61E. I put it in
        the repository `ut61e-web <https://github.com/pklaus/ut61e-web/>`__ on
        Github. It relies on the tools from this package.
        
        Alternatives
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        There is also a C++ based software out there which can read and
        interpret the data from the digital multimeter. The older version is
        called *dmm\_ut61e* and the newer version *ut61e-linux-sw*, both of
        which you can find in my repository
        `ut61e\_cpp <https://github.com/pklaus/ut61e_cpp>`__ on Github.
        
        If you run Windows, you may be better off with
        `DMM.exe <http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/hs/UNI-T/>`__, an open
        source tool provided by Henrik Haftmann.
        
        History
        ^^^^^^^
        
        The file es51922.py was originally written by Domas Jokubauskis
        (`1 <https://bitbucket.org/kuzavas/dmm_es51922/>`__) and was reused in
        this project. I'm very grateful to his work and the work of many others
        spent on analyzing the USB/HID interface and the protocol, including
        Steffen Vogel
        (`2 <http://www.noteblok.net/2009/11/29/uni-trend-ut61e-digital-multimeter/>`__)
        and Henrik Haftmann
        (`3 <http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/bastelecke/Rund%20um%20den%20PC/hid-ser>`__).
