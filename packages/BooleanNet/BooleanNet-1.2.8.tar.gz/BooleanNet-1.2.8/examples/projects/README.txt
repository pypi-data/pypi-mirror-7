
This folder contains the following case studies:

	- aba : Abcisic Acid Signaling
	- immune: Bordetella Bronchiseptica simulation 
	- LGL: T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia simulation

Each folder may contain multiple files. The files of main 
interest are the ones ending in -simulation.py and in -plot.py.

The simulations files were used to generate the data, the plot 
programs were used to generate the figures. 

Each folder already includes data for a long run so you can run 
the plotting program right away and it should  produce the 
figures published in the paper.
