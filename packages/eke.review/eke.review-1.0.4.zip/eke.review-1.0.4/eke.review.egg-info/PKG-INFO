        **********
        
        This component, ``eke.review``, enables researchers, clinicians, and
        scientists part of a collaborative group within the Early Detection
        Research Network (EDRN_) to perform quality analysis of the products of EDRN.
        It works with the rest of the EDRN Knowledge Environment (EKE_) on the EDRN
        public portal to enable easy and rapid turnaround during review cycles.
        
        Although intended for the EDRN public portal, this product may be installed
        into any Plone_ portal.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``eke.review`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eke.review
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

        A retrospective of the various releases this component has had, what's been
        changed, what's been fixed, and so forth, follows.
        
        
        1.0.4 — I Had Some Chicken; Pass Me the FLOSS
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        • First official release as free/libre/open source software.
        
        
        1.0.3 — Upgrades

        • Uses z3c.autoinclude to automatically include dependencies
        • Compatible with Plone 4.3.
        • Remove unneeded release config.
        
        
        1.0.2 — Test Support
        --------------------
        
        This release includes:
        
        * Depending on just Plone the framework instead of Plone the application.
        * Updating to the plone.app.testing fixtures.
