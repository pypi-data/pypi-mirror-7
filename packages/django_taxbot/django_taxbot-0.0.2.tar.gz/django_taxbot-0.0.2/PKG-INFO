Description: =============
        Django Taxbot
        =============
        
        This application attempts to make a little bit of sense out of the mess that is the tax landscape. 
        It uses a saved (and regularly updated and expanding) dictionary of aggregated taxes to figure out payable taxes based on a set of passed in values. 
        It bears noting that I have created this for my own use and while I intend to update is regularly, the accuracy of these values must be verified by the developer prior to use. 
        While I wait for a suitable API for tax aggregates, I have compiled my own list and based this application on that list.
        
        Presently, this application only handled taxes in Canada, parts of the US, in Great Britain and in Nigeria.
        
        
        -----------
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        1. Install easily with pip:
        ::
        
        		pip install django_taxbot
        
        
        
        2. Add to your installed apps:
        ::
        
        		INSTALLED_APPS = (
        
        			...
        			'taxbot',
        
        			...
        		)
        
        
        
        3. Import the TaxClient object in your projects and use as shown
        
        
        -----------------
        Detailed Overview
        -----------------
        
        This section details the way the application can be used.
        
        To create a new ``TaxClient``, simply import and use like so:
        
        	from taxbot import TaxClient
        
        	client = TaxClient()
        
        And just like that, we now have a new TaxClient. This client is initialized as Sales Tax client by default. To get Meal tax instead, pass in the ``M`` flag when initializing the client.
        ::
        
        	client = TaxClient('M')
        
        
        Now we'll go over the methods available to the client.
        
        
        
        tax_known(self, country, [region, city])
        ----------------------------------------
        This method returns a Boolean value which informs us if the tax for the location is known or not. 
        It is recommended that this method is called before any actions involving tax rates. Pass in as much information as possible to get the best results from this client. 
        
        The method expects the country to be in ISO-ALPHA-2 codes. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2. Region codes are 2 character alphas also and cities can be spelled out. 
        
        For countries with simple tax structures (Great Britain and Nigeria for now), the region and the city may be ignored.
        
        
        
        get_tax(self, country, [region, city])
        --------------------------------------
        Same as above, this method takes in 3 parameters.
        It calls on the ``tax_known`` method and so it is not necessary to call to the former beforehand. 
        
        This method returns the tax as a Decimal or in instances where tax structure is more complicated, returns a dictionary of applicable taxes. 
        
        ** Important ** Please check the type of return values from this method before using them.
        
        
        
        calculate_tax(self, amount, country, [region, city])
        ----------------------------------------------------
        In addition to the parameters above, this method accepts the value on which the tax is to be calculated and returns a dictionary of all calculated taxes.
        
        
        
        create_tax(self, amount, country [region, city])
        ------------------------------------------------
        In addition to the above, this method will create a ``Tax`` (and a ``CanadianTax``)object where the tax is known. Please refer to the code base in the app repository to view the fields available on the respective objects
        
        Cheers
