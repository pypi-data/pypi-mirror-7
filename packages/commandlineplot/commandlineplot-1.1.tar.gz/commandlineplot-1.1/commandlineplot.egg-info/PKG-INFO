Description: 
        clplot - command line plotting utility
        
            This utility is a command line front end to the matplotlib plotting
                module. This utility handles reading the data from file and determining
                the structure of the data. The utility attempts to make reasonable
                plot output using a collection of assumptions and inferences from the
                data. In many cases, reasonable output can be produced by the utility
                with the user providing nothing more than file names.
        
            when install with setuptools (or variant), an executable 'plot' is added
                to the user's path.
