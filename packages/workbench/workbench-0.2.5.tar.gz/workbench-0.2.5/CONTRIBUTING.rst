-------------------
Workbench uses the 'GitHub Flow' model: `GitHub Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`_ 

- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: my-awesome)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master

Getting Started
---------------
- Fork the repo on GitHub
- git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/workbench.git

New Feature or Bug
-----------------------------
- git checkout -b my-awesome
- git push -u origin my-awesome
- <code for a bit>; git push
- <code for a bit>; git push
- tox   (this will run all the tests)
- Go to github and hit 'New pull request'
- Someone reviews it and says 'AOK'
- Merge the pull request (green button)

Tips
----
	- A bird in the hand may be worth two in the bush but it's not nearly as fun...
