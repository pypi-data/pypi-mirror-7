Become a Developer
------------------
Workbench uses the 'GitHub Flow' model: `GitHub Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`_ 

- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: my-awesome)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Fork the repo on GitHub
	- git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/workbench.git
	
New Feature or Bug

	::
	
		$ git checkout -b my-awesome
		$ git push -u origin my-awesome
		$ <code for a bit>; git push
		$ <code for a bit>; git push
		$ tox (this will run all the tests)
	
	- Go to github and hit 'New pull request'
	- Someone reviews it and says 'AOK'
	- Merge the pull request (green button)
