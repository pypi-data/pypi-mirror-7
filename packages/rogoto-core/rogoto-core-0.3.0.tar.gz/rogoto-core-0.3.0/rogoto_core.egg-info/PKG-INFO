Description: # Rogoto Library
        
        Rogoto Library to control a BrickPI as a Logo Turtle built out of Lego Technics.
        
        This library will create parse commands and then tell the Lego Technics what to do.
        It allows people to draw items by doing the following:
        
        ```
            pendown
            forward 10
            right 90
            forward 10
            right 90
            forward 10
            right 90
            forward 10
            penup
        ```
        
        The above should put the pendown, draw a square and then lift the pen.
