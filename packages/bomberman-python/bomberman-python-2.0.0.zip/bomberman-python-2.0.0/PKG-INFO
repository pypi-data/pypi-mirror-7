Description: # Bomberman
        
        This is a Python client for the Bomberman HTTP API. It has been built
        and tested against Python 2.6.1.
        
        [Bomberman](http://addons.heroku.com/bomberman): shelter from profanity bombing, is an [add-on](http://addons.heroku.com) for Heroku
        applications. If you would like to be part of the alpha or early beta
        testing process please email <bomberman-support@ikayzo.com>.
        
        For detailed instructions on installing the addon to your Heroku
        application please see our [add-on documentation page](http://bomberman.ikayzo.com/)
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the Python client using pip.
        
        ```term
        $ pip install bomberman-python
        ```
        
        Before making client requests, make sure your environment contains your API key. If you're using Heroku or Foreman, this should already be set for you.
        
        ```term
        $ export BOMBERMAN_API_KEY=<your api key>
        ```
        
        For users of the Bomberman Heroku addon, please, uncomment line 8 of the connection.py file.
        
        Once that is done, create the client in your Python code.
        ```python
        from bomberman.client import Client
        
        bomberman = Client()
        ```
        
        ### Checking if Text Contains Profanity
        
        To check if a piece of text or *corpus* contains profanity use the
        `.is_profane(corpus)` method.  This will return a boolean value as the
        result
        
        ```python
        non_profane_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
        bomberman.is_profane(non_profane_text)
          #=> False
        profane_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the F-BOMBing lazy dog."
        bomberman.is_profane(profane_text)
          #=> True
        ```
        
        ### Censoring Profane Words & Phrases
        
        If you would like to save or display text where the profane words (if
        any) are censored, use the `.censor(corpus, replacement_text)` method.
        
        ```python
        non_profane_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
        bomberman.censor(non_profane_text, "####")
          #=> "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
        profane_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the F-BOMBing lazy dog."
        bomberman.censor(profane_text, "####")
          #=> "The quick brown fox jumped over the ### lazy dog."
        ```
        
        The `replacement_text` parameter is a string and optional. `"***"` is
        suppled by default.
        
        ### Highlighting Profane Words & Phrases
        
        Sometimes it is useful to leave the original profane word/phrase intact
        but wrap it in some sort of tag to make it stand out. This can be
        accomplished with the `.highlight(corpus, start_tag, end_tag)` method.
        
        ```python
        non_profane_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
        bomberman.highlight(non_profane_text, "<blink>", "</blink>")
          #=> "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
        profane_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the F-BOMBing lazy dog."
        bomberman.highlight(profane_text, "<blink>", "</blink>")
          #=> "The quick brown fox jumped over the <blink>F-BOMBing</blink> lazy dog."
        ```
        
        The `start_tag` & `end_tag` parameters are strings and optional. A pair
        of opening and closing `<strong>` tags are used if none are provided.
