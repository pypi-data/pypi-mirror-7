        Clean, colorful test runner for Python
        --------------------------------------
        
        Green is a clean, colorful test runner for Python unit tests.  Compare it to
        nose or trial.
        
        Green grew out of a desire to see pretty colors.  Really!  A big part of the
        whole the **Red/Green/Refactor** process in test-driven-development is
        _actually getting to see red and green output_.  Most python unit testing
        actually goes **Gray/Gray/Refactor** (at least on my terminal, which is gray
        text on black background).  That's a shame.  Even TV is in color these days.
        Why not terminal output?  Even worse, the default output for most test runners
        is cluttered, hard-to-read, redundant, and the dang statuses are not aligned
        vertically!  Green fixes all that.
        
        ### Features ###
        
        - Colored terminal output
        - Aligned status indicators
        - Test discovery
        - Flexible test target specification
        - No new objects to learn -- just use normal `unittest` classes.
        - HTML output
        - Four verbosity levels
        - Built-in, optional, integration with
          [coverage](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/)
        - Supports Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and [PyPy](http://pypy.org)
        - Completely supports OS X and Linux, most likely BSDs (and maybe Windows,
          someone want to try it and let me know?)
        
        ### Wish List ###
        
        - Parallel test-running (multiprocessing)
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        The simplest way is to just run `green` directory of your project.  (For
        convenience, you can also use `greenX` or `greenX.Y`, where `X` and `Y` are the
        major and minor version number of your Python installation.)
        
        By default, Green mimics the verbosity levels of vanilla unittest or nose,
        meaning that output is mostly just dots.  For Green we recommend adding more
        verbosity by using the `-v` or `-vv` options.
        
        To run Green's own internal unit tests (which are hopefully all passing):
        
            green -v green
        
        To see all examples of all the failures, errors, etc. that could occur:
        
            green -v green.examples
        
        
        Advanced Usage
        --------------
        
        Please see `green --help`
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Replace `pip3` with your version of pip if necessary.  You may need to prepend
        this command with `sudo` or run it as root if your normal user cannot write to
        the local Python package directory.
        
            pip3 install green
        
        
        Upgrade
        -------
        
            pip3 install --upgrade green
        
        Wait...what do I have installed?
        
            green --version
        
        
        Uninstall
        ---------
        
            pip3 uninstall green
