.. _styles:

Using stylesheets and javascript in your course
================================================

The Moodle oppia export block comes by default with a single style that will be 
applied to any courses you export - so the stylesheet and related resources 
(images etc) will get exported to the course package too.


Creating your own style
------------------------
To add a new style (or adapt the existing one), create an new css file in the 
<block>/styles directory, along with a new directory for the resources (see the 
current folder structure).
