        Fundamental Features
        ====================
        
        - Enables everyone to contribute to your content---while retaining your full control.
        - Supports all four common collaboration and support patterns in several ways:
        
          #. *Active contribution* (create content, contribute corrections)
          #. *Passive contribution* (report issues, assign tasks, provide feedback)
          #. *Active consumption* (search and browse for content)
          #. *Passive consumption* (subscribe to notifications)
        
        - Continually involves, helps and optimally supports your collaborators by sending out reminders, editing and
          submission hints to avoid losing traction or interest.
