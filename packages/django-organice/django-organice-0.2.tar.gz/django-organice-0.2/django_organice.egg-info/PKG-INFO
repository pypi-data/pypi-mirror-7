        - Continually involves, helps and optimally supports your collaborators by sending out reminders, editing and
          submission hints to avoid losing traction or interest.
        - Supports all four common collaboration and support patterns in several ways:
        
          #. *Active contribution* (create content, contribute corrections)

          #. *Active consumption* (search and browse for content)
          #. *Passive consumption* (subscribe to notifications)
