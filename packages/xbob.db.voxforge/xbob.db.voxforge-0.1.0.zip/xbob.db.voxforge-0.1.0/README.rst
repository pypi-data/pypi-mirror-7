Speaker recognition protocol on the Voxforge Database 
=====================================================

`Voxforge`_ offers a collection transcribed speech for use with **Free** and **Open Source Speech Recognition Engines**. 
In this package, we design a speaker recognition protocol that uses a **small subset of the english audio files** (only 6561 files) belonging to **30 speakers** randomly selected.
This subset is split into three equivalent parts: Training (10 speakers), Development (10 speakers) and Test (10 speakers) sets.
 
This package serves as a toy example of speaker recognition database while testing `xbob.spkrec`_.

The `xbob.spkrec`_  is developed at Idiap during its participation to the `NIST SRE 2012 evaluation`_. If you use this package and/or its results, please cite the following
publications:

1. The original paper presented at the NIST SRE 2012 workshop::

Installation
------------

Just download this package and decompress it locally::

  $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/x/xbob.db.voxforge/xbob.db.voxforge-0.0.1a2.zip
  $ unzip xbob.db.voxforge-0.0.1a2.zip
  $ cd xbob.db.voxforge-0.0.1a2

Use buildout to bootstrap and have a working environment ready for
experiments::

  $ python bootstrap
  $ ./bin/buildout

This also requires that bob (>= 1.2.0) is installed.


Getting the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data can be downloaded from its original URL (on Voxforge) and extracted by running `download_and_untar.sh`_ that takes as input the path in which the data will be stored::

  $ ./download_and_untar.sh PATH/TO/WAV/DIRECTORY

.. _Voxforge: http://www.voxforge.org/
.. _xbob.spkrec: https://github.com/bioidiap/xbob.spkrec
