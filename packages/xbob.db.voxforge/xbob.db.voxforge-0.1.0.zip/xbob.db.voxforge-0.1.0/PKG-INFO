Description: Speaker recognition protocol on the Voxforge Database 
        =====================================================
        
        `Voxforge`_ offers a collection transcribed speech for use with **Free** and **Open Source Speech Recognition Engines**. 
        In this package, we design a speaker recognition protocol that uses a **small subset of the english audio files** (only 6561 files) belonging to **30 speakers** randomly selected.
        This subset is split into three equivalent parts: Training (10 speakers), Development (10 speakers) and Test (10 speakers) sets.
         
        This package serves as a toy example of speaker recognition database while testing `xbob.spkrec`_.
        
        The `xbob.spkrec`_  is developed at Idiap during its participation to the `NIST SRE 2012 evaluation`_. If you use this package and/or its results, please cite the following
        publications:
        
        1. The original paper presented at the NIST SRE 2012 workshop::
        
             @inproceedings{Khoury_NISTSRE_2012,
               author = {Khoury, Elie and El Shafey, Laurent and Marcel, S{\'{e}}bastien},
               month = {dec},
               title = {The Idiap Speaker Recognition Evaluation System at NIST SRE 2012},
               booktitle = {NIST Speaker Recognition Conference},
               year = {2012},
               location = {Orlando, USA},
               organization = {NIST},

            }
        
        2. Bob as the core framework used to run the experiments::

              title = {Bob: a free signal processing and machine learning toolbox for researchers},
              year = {2012},
              month = oct,
              booktitle = {20th ACM Conference on Multimedia Systems (ACMMM), Nara, Japan},
              publisher = {ACM Press},
              url = {http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2012/Anjos_Bob_ACMMM12.pdf},
            }
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just download this package and decompress it locally::
        
          $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/x/xbob.db.voxforge/xbob.db.voxforge-0.0.1a2.zip
          $ unzip xbob.db.voxforge-0.0.1a2.zip
          $ cd xbob.db.voxforge-0.0.1a2
        
        Use buildout to bootstrap and have a working environment ready for
        experiments::
        
          $ python bootstrap
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        This also requires that bob (>= 1.2.0) is installed.
        
        
        Getting the data
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The data can be downloaded from its original URL (on Voxforge) and extracted by running `download_and_untar.sh`_ that takes as input the path in which the data will be stored::
        
          $ ./download_and_untar.sh PATH/TO/WAV/DIRECTORY
