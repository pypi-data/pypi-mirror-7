Description: ==========================================
        NTracer
        ==========================================
        A fast hyper-spacial ray-tracing library
        ------------------------------------------
        
        **Important:** this library makes extensive use of features exclusive to C++11.
        At the time of this writing, the only compilers that can build this library are
        GCC >= 4.7 and Clang >= 3.1.
        
        NTracer is a simple ray-tracer that can work with scenes with an arbitrary
        number of dimensions.

        The renderer can use an arbitrary number of threads and by default uses as many
        threads as there are processing cores. For small dimensionalities (by default,
        eight or fewer dimensions), the library uses specialized routines with the
        number of dimensions hard-coded, which offer better performance by avoiding the
        looping and heap allocation that the generic versions require.
        
        The main goal is to aid in the visualization of higher-dimensional space.
        
        There is special support for Pygame, but it is not a requirement. However, the
        included example scripts, hypercube.py and polytope.py, depend on it.
