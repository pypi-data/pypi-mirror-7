Description: 
        OncodriveFM
        ===========
        
        OncodriveFM detects candidate cancer driver genes and pathways from catalogs of somatic mutations
        in a cohort of tumors by computing the bias towards the accumulation of functional mutations (FM bias).
        This novel approach avoids some known limitations of recurrence-based approaches,
        such as the difficulty to estimate background mutation rate, and the fact that they usually fail to identify
        lowly recurrently mutated driver genes.
