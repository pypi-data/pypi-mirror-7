=================

The generic library makefile (Library.mk) should be able to compile most libraries, but if it can't, you can define a custom makefile in this directory.

Please help expand the selection of "compilable" libraries by submitting makefiles, testing the generic makefile & improving dependencies.py

Makefiles should be named the same as their library folder, with a .mk extension. (e.g. Ethernet.mk)

Naturally, there's nothing to stop you from defining makefiles for your own custom libraries.
