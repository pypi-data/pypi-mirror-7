Description: PdCommPy
        ========
        
        A Python wrapper for Nortek's PdCommATL COM library.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
          * Install Nortek's PdCommATL library (contact Nortek to obtain the necessary installer).
          * Run win32com's `makepy.py` module (located, for example, at `C:\python27\Lib\site-packages\win32com\client`),
            selecting "PdCommATL 1.0 Type Library (1.0)" from the list.
          * Either run `pip install pdcommpy`, or `git clone` this repository, and inside 
            run `python setup.py install` from a command prompt.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```python
        >>> from pdcommpy import PdControl
        >>> pdcontrol = PdControl()
        >>> pdcontrol.serial_port = "COM2"
        >>> pdcontrol.state
        'Not connected'
        >>> pdcontrol.sample_rate = 200
        >>> pdcontrol.coordinate_system
        'ENU'
        ```
        
        Known issues
        ------------
          * Salinity in data files is indicated as "N/A". According to Nortek, this should not affect the measurements.
