        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.listings into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.listings add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.listings on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.listings
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.listings either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Components
        ----------
        Navigate to the "Components" tab of your article and select one of the listing
        components and press "save and view". Note that at least one article has to be contained
        in the article in which this component is active.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Set ``listings_<component>_titletop`` property to ``True`` to display the title
        above the image, use ``False`` to display it below the teaser-image.
        
        ``listings_<component>_caption`` shows the image caption below the image (in
        case it differs from the article title)
        
        ``listings_<component>_wysiwyg`` will show the richtext content of the
        additional textfield in case `raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg`_ is installed.
        
        .. _`raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptus.article.additionalwysiwyg
        
        
        plone.app.imaging
        `````````````````
        
        To use plone.app.imaging scales simply set the corresponding properties to the
        name if the image scale.
        
        You'll need to have `raptus.article.teaser` installed for having teaser images
        available on articles.
        
        
        If present, those will overrule the width and height settings.
        
        Available properties:
        
        * ``teaser_listingleft_scale``
        * ``teaser_listingright_scale``
        * ``teaser_listingcolumns_scale``
