Django-Softmachine proposes an approach based on DATARUN method.
This approach consists in achieving the interfaces of an application by the contruction of views from a normalized data model.

In other words, you can prototype and export a new application model.
The system architecture is a Web MVC variant, this means that we use the basic concepts of Model, View and Controller adapted to a Meta-Data Driven Web App.
